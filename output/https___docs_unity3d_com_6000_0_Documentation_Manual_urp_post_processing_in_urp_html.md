Introduction to post-processing in URP
# Post-processing in URP
Approaches and resources for applying **post-processing** A process that improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#post-processing) effects to create stylised visuals, or simulate physical **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) and film properties in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)
