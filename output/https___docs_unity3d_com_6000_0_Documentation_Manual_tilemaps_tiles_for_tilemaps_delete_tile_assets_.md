# Delete tile assets
When you delete tile assets in their save location, the **Tile Palette** editor replaces them with placeholder tiles in the tile palette and **tilemaps** A GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid overlay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tilemaps/work-with-tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Tilemap).
Each deleted tile asset has a corresponding placeholder tile with a unique shade of pink that differentiates the placeholders from each other. On the tilemap, these placeholder tiles remain in the original position of the deleted tiles. This helps you to identify the deleted tile assets and the areas on the tilemaps they affect.
