albedoSwatches; 
### Description
Returns an array of [AlbedoSwatchInfo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.AlbedoSwatchInfo.html).
The physically based rendering validation tools have a set of built-in albedo values it will validate your materials against. Every game may have different albedo values it wants to validate against. This property will override the default albedo values with an array of user specified data. See [AlbedoSwatchInfo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.AlbedoSwatchInfo.html) for albedo swatch information. Also see [DrawCameraMode.ValidateAlbedo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/DrawCameraMode.ValidateAlbedo.html) and [DrawCameraMode.ValidateMetalSpecular](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/DrawCameraMode.ValidateMetalSpecular.html) for information enabling the validation tools.
