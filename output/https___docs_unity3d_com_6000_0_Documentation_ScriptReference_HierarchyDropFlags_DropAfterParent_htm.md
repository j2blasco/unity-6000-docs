### Description
Drop a dragged object into the first child position after the parent of the Hierarchy item when the mouse is hovering between the parent and the first child. The dropTargetInstanceID is the first child under a parent and the dropped object is inserted between the parent and the first child. When using DropAfterParent, DropBetween and DropAbove are also used to provide information to locate the dropped object.
