public static float Distance([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) a, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) b); 
### Description
Returns the distance between `a` and `b`.
`Vector3.Distance(a,b)` is the same as `(a-b).magnitude`.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

{
    public Transform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) other;  
  
    void Example()
    {
        if (other)
        {
            float dist = Vector3.Distance[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.Distance.html)(other.position, transform.position);
            print("Distance to other: " + dist);
