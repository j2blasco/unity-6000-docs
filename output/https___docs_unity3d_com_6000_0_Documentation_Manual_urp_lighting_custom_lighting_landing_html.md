Introduction to custom lighting in URP
# Custom lighting in URP
Implement custom lighting models to have more control over the visual style and achieve better performance.

[Introduction to custom lighting in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/lighting/custom-lighting-introduction.html) | An overview of approaches to implementing custom lighting.  
[Render additional lights in a shader in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/use-built-in-shader-methods-additional-lights-fplus.html) | Create a light loop and iterate over additional lights in the Forward+ and Forward **rendering paths** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#RenderingPath).  
[Change how lights fade using light falloff in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/lighting/custom-lighting-change-light-falloff.html) | Create a unique visual style in your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) by changing the light falloff function for real-time and baked lighting.
