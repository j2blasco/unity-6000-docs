# Use bar sliders
A bar slider lets you allocate sections of a whole. For example, the [level of detail (LOD) Group component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-LODGroup.html) uses a bar slider to define transitions between the levels. All levels together make up 100%.
To change allocations, drag the divider between two sections left or right. This changes both sections at the same time, but doesnâ€™t change any other section.
Each section in a bar slider shows how far into the whole it reaches, indicated as a percentage. That percentage is the end point for the section, not the total allocation of that section. The last section is always 100%.
