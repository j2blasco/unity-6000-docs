### Description
Use material names in the form <textureName>.mat.
Material names will be accepted in the form _< textureName>.mat_ (ie, the diffuse texture name of the imported material) when searching for existing materials or creating new ones.  
  
If the imported material doesn't have a diffuse texture assigned then a name in the form _< materialName>.mat_ will be used instead.
