[PlayableDirector](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Playables.PlayableDirector.html) | Instantiates a PlayableGraph from a PlayableAsset and controls playback of Playable objects. This API is mainly designed to provide scheduling and scene binding support and scheduling for the Timeline package. Our users may find limited use for it otherwise.
