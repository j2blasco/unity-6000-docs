### Description
OnGUI is called for rendering and handling GUI events.
OnGUI is the only function that can implement the ["Immediate Mode" GUI (IMGUI)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GUIScriptingGuide.html) system for rendering and handling GUI events. Your OnGUI implementation might be called several times per frame (one call per event). For more information on GUI events see the [Event](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Event.html) reference. If the MonoBehaviour's enabled property is set to false, OnGUI() will not be called.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnGUI()
    {
        if (GUI.Button[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.Button.html)(new Rect[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html)(10, 10, 150, 100), "I am a button"))
        {
            print("You clicked the button!");
        }
    }
}
