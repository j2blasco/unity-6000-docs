[Switch to Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html "Go to ArticulationBody page in the Scripting Reference")
Articulation Bodies enable you to build [physics articulations](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/physics-articulations.html) such as robotic arms or kinematic chains with **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) that are hierarchically organized. They help you get realistic physics behaviors in the context of simulation for industrial applications.
## Properties
An Articulation Body allows you to define in one single component the properties that you would similarly define through a [RigidBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RigidbodiesOverview.html)A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Rigidbody) and a [regular Joint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html) in a classic configuration. That said, these properties depend on the GameObject position in the hierarchy:
  * For the root GameObject of the articulation, you can only set up physical body properties:


![Root Articulation Body component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-properties-root.png)
  * For any child GameObject within the articulation, you can set up physical body properties as well as the type and properties of the **joint** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint) that links this GameObject to its parent GameObject:


![Child Articulation Body component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-properties-child.png)
The Articulation Body properties fall into the following main categories:
  * [Physical body properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#physical-body-properties)
  * [Joint anchor properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#joint-anchor-properties)
  * [Joint type selection and properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#joint-type-selection-and-joint-properties)
  * [Joint drive properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#joint-drive-properties)


### Physical body properties
Define the way the Articulation Body responds to the physics environment.
![Physical body properties in the Inspector.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-properties-physical-body.png) Physical body properties in the Inspector. **Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Mass** | The mass of the Articulation Body (in kilograms by default).  
**Immovable** | Use this property to define whether this articulation body is movable or not. You can set this property only for the root Articulation Body. This property is useful to make the base body of robotic hands immovable, for example. The **physics engine** A system that simulates aspects of physical systems so that objects can accelerate correctly and be affected by collisions, gravity and other forces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PhysicsSection.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#PhysicsEngine) solves it separately from all the other constraints and guarantees that it is not violated.  
**Use Gravity** | Use this property to make the gravity affect this Articulation Body or not.  
### Joint anchor properties
Define the coordinates of the [joint anchors](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#joint-anchors) for the Articulation Body and its parent Articulation Body.
![Joint anchor properties in the Inspector.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-properties-joint-anchor.png) Joint anchor properties in the Inspector. **Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Compute Parent Anchor** | Enable this property to make the parent-relative anchor match the anchor of the current Articulation Body. If you disable this property, you can separately set values for **Parent Anchor Position** and **Parent Anchor Rotation**.  
**Anchor Position** | The position coordinates of the Anchor, relative to the current Articulation Body.  
**Anchor Rotation** | The rotation coordinates of the Anchor, relative to the current Articulation Body.

**Parent Anchor Rotation** | The rotation coordinates of the Parent Anchor, relative to the parent Articulation Body. This property only appears if you disable **Compute Parent Anchor**.  
**Snap Anchor to closest contact** | Computes the point on the surface of this Articulation Body that is closest to the **center of mass** Represents the average position of all mass in a Rigidbody for the purposes of physics calculations. By default it is computed from all colliders belonging to the Rigidbody, but can be modified via script. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-centerOfMass.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#CenterofMass) of the parent Articulation Body, and sets the anchor to it. If **Compute Parent Anchor** is enabled, Unity also updates the parent anchor accordingly.  
### Joint type selection and joint properties
Select the type of joint that links the current Articulation Body to its parent Articulation Body, and define its common and specific properties.
![Joint type properties in the Inspector.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-properties-joint-type.png) Joint type properties in the Inspector. **Property** | **Description**

![Joint drive properties in the Inspector.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-properties-joint-drive.png) Joint drive properties in the Inspector. **Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Lower Limit** | The limit below which the joint prevents the body from moving or rotating, depending on the joint type. You can define this property only if you set the related **Motion** , **Swing** or **Twist** property to **Limited**.  
**Upper Limit** | The limit above which the joint prevents the body from moving or rotating, depending on the joint type. You can define this property only if you set the related **Motion** , **Swing** or **Twist** property to **Limited**.

**Force limit** | The maximum amount of force or torque this drive can produce.  
**Target** | The target value this drive aims to reach.  
****Target velocity** A joint property to set the desired velocity with which the joint should move to the Target Position under the drive force. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ConfigurableJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#TargetVelocity)** | The target velocity this drive aims to reach.  
## Configuring articulation joints
### Joint drive effect
Any drive is an implicit 1D spring that aims to bring the current drive parameters to the target by the application of an effect (forces or torques) computed by this formula:
```
Effect = stiffness * (targetPosition - drivePosition) + damping * (targetVelocity - driveVelocity)
î¥£
```

A drive attached to a linear degree of freedom produces forces. A drive attached to a rotational degree of freedom produces torques. You can set each parameter of this formula through the [Joint drive properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#joint-drive-properties) to fine-tune the desired effect for any axis involved in a joint.
Notice that the effect formula consists of two independent terms that you can balance, and even cancel out. For example:
  * If you set the stiffness to zero, you get a drive that only aims at reaching a specific velocity.
  * If you set the damping to zero, you get a drive that aims at reaching a certain position without trying to reach any particular velocity. In that case, the drive does not try to eventually stop once the target is reached.


## Joint anchors
There are two anchors per each joint:
  * The **Anchor** , relative to the current Articulation Body
  * The **Parent Anchor** , relative to the parent Articulation Body


By default, Unity automatically computes the Parent Anchor to match the pose of the Anchor. However, you can disable the **Compute Parent Anchor** property to manually set the Parent Anchor:
![Compute Parent Anchor in the Inspector.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-properties-joint-anchors.png) Compute Parent Anchor in the Inspector.
Currently, the Unity Editor displays the anchors with a scaled transform tool to differentiate them from the GameObject transform tool:
![A sphere and cube in the Unity Editor with scaled transform tools.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-joint-anchor-tools.png) A sphere and cube in the Unity Editor with scaled transform tools.
To change the position of the anchors, you can either use the Inspector and edit the [Joint anchor properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#joint-anchor-properties) or directly move and rotate their transform tools in the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) View.
**Note:** When you create a new Articulation Body, Unity positions the anchors at the local zero of their respective bodies. However, the local zero is not an ideal default position for the anchor if the connected bodies have **colliders** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesnâ€™t need to be exactly the same shape as the objectâ€™s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collider) attached, because the joint might then try to push the bodies into each other. The **Snap Anchor to closest contact** button helps you set a more reasonable default location of the anchors, which works with many articulations.
### Joint degrees of freedom and limits
**Note:** Currently, the **Scene View** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SceneView) allows you to visualize the joint limits but not to manipulate them graphically.
#### Fixed joint
A **fixed joint** A joint type that is completely constrained, allowing two objects to be held together. Implemented as a spring so some motion may still occur. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-FixedJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#FixedJoint) has no degrees of freedom, so the Scene View displays no specific markers.
#### Prismatic joint
A prismatic joint is practically a slider along a specified axis relative to the parent anchor. This axis can only be a basis axis (X, Y, or Z) but you can still [rotate the parent anchor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#joint-anchors) to get a different axis orientation in world space.
You can set up a prismatic joint to have a free or limited translation. To do this, use the Inspector and edit the [prismatic joint specific properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#prismatic-joint-additional-properties).
**Note:** You cannot lock a prismatic joint, otherwise this would remove its only degree of freedom and would make it a degenerate joint.
When you set the prismatic joint **Motion** to **Limited** , the Scene View displays markers to represent the translation limits:
  * The small red marker represents the lower limit.
  * The small green marker represents the upper limit.
  * The dotted white line materializes allowed translation between the limits.


To manipulate the joint limits, you must use the Inspector and edit their values in the [Joint drive properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#joint-drive-properties).
![Example of a limited prismatic joint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-joint-prismatic-limited.png) Example of a limited prismatic joint
**Note:** The Scene View displays no specific markers when you set the prismatic joint **Motion** to **Free**.
#### Revolute joint
A revolute joint is essentially a hinge with a single rotational degree of freedom around the parent anchorâ€™s X axis. You can still [rotate the parent anchor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#joint-anchors) to get a different axis orientation in world space.
You can set up a revolute joint to have a free or limited rotation. To do this, use the Inspector and edit the [revolute joint specific properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#revolute-joint-additional-properties).
**Note:** You cannot lock a revolute joint, otherwise this would remove its only degree of freedom and would make it a degenerate joint.
When you set the revolute joint **Motion** to **Free** , the Scene View displays a red disk to represent the free rotation allowed around the X axis.
![Example of a free revolute joint.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-joint-revolute-free.png) Example of a free revolute joint.
When you set the revolute joint **Motion** to **Limited** , the Scene View displays markers to represent the rotation limits:
  * The small red marker represents the lower limit.
  * The small green marker represents the upper limit.
  * The red circle sector materializes the allowed rotation angle between the limits.
  * The Z axis of the parent anchor serves as the reference (zero) for both limit angles.


To manipulate the joint limits, you must use the Inspector and edit their values in the [Joint drive properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#joint-drive-properties).
![Example of a limited revolute joint.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-joint-revolute-limited.png) Example of a limited revolute joint.
#### Spherical joint
A spherical joint is an anatomical joint that is best suited for simulating humanoid limbs.
This joint type can have up to three rotational degrees of freedom. You can set up each of these rotations to be free, limited, or locked. To do this, use the Inspector and edit the [revolute joint specific properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#revolute-joint-additional-properties).
**Note:** You cannot lock all rotations at the same time for a spherical joint, otherwise this would remove all its degrees of freedom and would make it a degenerate joint. Also, you should not lock both swing axes to mimic a revolute joint, because the simulation would happen differently than with the revolute joint and would be more expensive.
Like with the [revolute joint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html#revolute-joint):
  * The Scene View displays free rotations with colored disks and limited rotations with colored circle sectors. Each color (red, green, blue) represents the rotation around the axis of this color (respectively: X, Y, Z).
  * The small red and green markers respectively represent the lower and upper limits.

![Example of a free spherical joint.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-joint-spherical-free.png) Example of a free spherical joint. ![Example of a spherical joint with limited swings.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/articulation-body-joint-spherical-limited.png) Example of a spherical joint with limited swings.
