### Description
Validates whether custom bounds can be calculated for this Editor.
Use this to validate if [Editor.OnGetFrameBounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.OnGetFrameBounds.html) should be called for this window. The Scene view calls `HasFrameBounds` and `OnGetFrameBounds` when the Frame action is invoked. The Frame action can be called from anywhere, but it is commonly called when you press the F key to frame the selected GameObject. 
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);  
  
// This example traverses all bones in the hierarchy and calculates bounds for the entire object
public class GameObjectEditorWindow: Editor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.html)
{
    private bool HasFrameBounds()
    {
        // the result of this function depends on implementation
        // it will most likely be used to evaluate whether bounds
        // can exist for the targets of this Editor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.html) Window
        return Selection.objects.Length > 0;
    }  
  
    public Bounds[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Bounds.html) OnGetFrameBounds()
    {
        Transform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) bone = Selection.activeTransform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Selection-activeTransform.html);
        Bounds[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Bounds.html) bounds = new Bounds[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Bounds.html)(bone.position, new Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html)(0, 0, 0));
        foreach (Transform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) child in bone)
            bounds.Encapsulate(child.position);  
  
        if (bone.parent) bounds.Encapsulate(bone.parent.position);  
  
        return bounds;
    }
}
```
