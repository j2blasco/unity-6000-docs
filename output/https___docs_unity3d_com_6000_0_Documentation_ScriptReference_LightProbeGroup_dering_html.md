### Description
Removes ringing from probes if enabled (Editor only).
Ringing is an artifact that can occur on probes if they are subject to drastic changes in lighting. Light may overshoot and appear in the opposite end of the probe. This feature can remove ringing on probes if enabled, but may reduce overall contrast.
