stitchEdges; 
### Description
Whether pairs of edges should be stitched together.
When true, Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination identifies the pair of edges that should be stitched together and produces radiosity which is as smooth as possible across the seam. This parameter applies only to straight edges which run horizontally or vertically along chart boundaries in the atlas; the method is designed to work with rectangles which are axis-aligned in UV space.
