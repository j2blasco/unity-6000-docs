solverIterations; 
### Description
The solverIterations determines how accurately Rigidbody joints and collision contacts are resolved. Overrides [Physics.defaultSolverIterations](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics-defaultSolverIterations.html). Must be positive.
If you are having trouble with connected Rigidbodies oscillating and behaving erratically setting a higher solver iteration count may improve their stability (but is slower).
