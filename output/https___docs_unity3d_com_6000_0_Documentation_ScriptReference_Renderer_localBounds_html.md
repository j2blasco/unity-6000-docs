[Bounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Bounds.html) localBounds; 
### Description
The bounding box of the renderer in local space.
This is the axis-aligned bounding box fully enclosing the object in local space.  
  
For a [SkinnedMeshRenderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SkinnedMeshRenderer.html), default local bounds are precomputed based on animations associated with that model, which means that the bounding box might be much bigger than the mesh itself. When [SkinnedMeshRenderer.updateWhenOffscreen](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SkinnedMeshRenderer-updateWhenOffscreen.html) is enabled, Unity recomputes the local bounds every frame.  
  
You can override the default bounding box by setting your own local space bounding box. This is mostly useful when the renderer uses a shader that does custom vertex deformations, and the default bounding box is not accurate. Use [ResetLocalBounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer.ResetLocalBounds.html) to remove custom bounds override. Note that the custom local bounds value is not saved into scenes or prefabs and has to be set from a script at runtime.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class DrawRendererBounds : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Draws a wireframe box around the selected object,
    // indicating local space bounding volume.
    public void OnDrawGizmosSelected()
    {
        var r = GetComponent<Renderer[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer.html)>();
        if (r == null)
            return;
        var bounds = r.localBounds;
        Gizmos.matrix[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos-matrix.html) = transform.localToWorldMatrix;
        Gizmos.color[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos-color.html) = Color.blue[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color-blue.html);
        Gizmos.DrawWireCube[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.DrawWireCube.html)(bounds.center, bounds.extents * 2);
    }
}

```
