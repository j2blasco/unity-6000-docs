separateMRTBlendStates; 
### Description
Determines whether each render target uses a separate blend state.
If `false`, all render targets use [blendState0](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.BlendState-blendState0.html). Otherwise render target 0 uses [blendState0](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.BlendState-blendState0.html), render target 1 uses [blendState1](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.BlendState-blendState1.html) etc.
