### Description
When this flag is set, Unity performs occlusion culling as part of the culling operation.
Default value: set if the [Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) from which you obtained the CullingParameters object has [Camera.useOcclusionCulling](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-useOcclusionCulling.html) set to `true`. Otherwise, unset.
