[Configure lightmapping with a Lighting Settings Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/global-illumination-configure.html) | Create a set of lightmapping settings and assign them to a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene).  
[Change the fade distance of lights with fall-off](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ProgressiveLightmapper-CustomFallOff.html) | Change the rate at which light fades in **lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that contains the effects of light sources on static objects in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the effect of lighting. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Lightmap) using a script.  
[Store light direction with Directional Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightmappingDirectional.html) | Improve lighting by generating an extra lightmap texture that stores light direction and amount.
