autoConfigureConnectedAnchor; 
### Description
Should the `connectedAnchor` be calculated automatically?
If this is enabled, then the `connectedAnchor` property will be calculated automatically to match the global position of the `anchor` property. This is the default behavior. If this is disabled, you can configure the position of the connected anchor using the `connectedAnchor` property.
