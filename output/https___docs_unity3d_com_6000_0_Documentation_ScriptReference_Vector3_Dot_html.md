## Declaration
public static float Dot([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) lhs, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) rhs); 
### Description
Dot Product of two vectors.
The dot product is a float value equal to the magnitudes of the two vectors multiplied together and then multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them.  
  
For [normalized](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-normalized.html) vectors Dot returns 1 if they point in exactly the same direction, -1 if they point in completely opposite directions and zero if the vectors are perpendicular.
