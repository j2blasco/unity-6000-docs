# Optimizing your code for managed memory
C#â€™s automatic memory management reduces the risk of memory leaks and other programming errors, in comparison to other programming languages like C++, where you must manually track and free all the memory you allocate.
Automatic memory management allows you to write code quickly and with few errors. However, this convenience might have performance implications. To optimize your code for performance, you must avoid situations where your application triggers the [garbage collector](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/performance-garbage-collector.html) a lot. This section outlines some common issues and workflows that affect when your application triggers the garbage collector.
**Topic** | **Description**
