# Scoped registries
Use scoped registries to communicate the location of any custom package registry server to the Package Manager, so you can access several collections of packages at the same time. 
Organizations often use scoped registries as a mechanism to distribute custom packages within the organization. 
This information covers how to use scoped registries as a package consumer and package provider.
