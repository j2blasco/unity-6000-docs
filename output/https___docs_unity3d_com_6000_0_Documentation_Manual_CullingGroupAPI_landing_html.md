Introduction to the CullingGroup API
# Configure culling with the CullingGroup API
Resources for integrating your own systems into Unityâ€™s culling and **level of detail** The _Level Of Detail_ (LOD) technique is an optimization that reduces the number of triangles that Unity has to render for a GameObject when its distance from the Camera increases. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LevelOfDetail.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#levelofdetail) (LOD) pipelines.

[CullingGroup API](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CullingGroupAPI.html) | Learn about using the CullingGroup API to create culling groups, for example to simulate a crowd of people or build a **particle system** A component that simulates fluid entities such as liquids, clouds and flames by generating and animating large numbers of small 2D images in the scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ParticleSystem.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#particlesystem).  
[Create a Culling Group](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CullingGroupAPI-getstarted.html) | Create and populate an array of bounding spheres that contain **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) objects.  
[Get culling results](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CullingGroupAPI-get-culling-results.html) | Check the visibility and distance of scene objects.
