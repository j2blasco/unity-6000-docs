### Description
Linearly interpolate between the gradient keys.
This mode finds the two keys adjacent to the requested evaluation time, and interpolates between them.  
  
Note that a simple linear interpolation between color keys of very different hue can look unnatural. Using [GradientMode.PerceptualBlend](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GradientMode.PerceptualBlend.html) can often result in a more natural looking color blend.
