### Description
OnCollisionStay is called once per frame for every Collider or Rigidbody that touches another Collider or Rigidbody.
In contrast to OnTriggerStay, OnCollisionStay is passed the [Collision](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html) class and not a Collider. The [Collision](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html) class contains information about contact points, impact velocity etc. If you don't use collisionInfo in the function, leave out the collisionInfo parameter as this avoids unneccessary calculations. Notes: Collision events are only sent if one of the colliders also has a non-kinematic rigidbody attached. Collision events are sent to disabled MonoBehaviours, to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions. Collision stay events are not sent for sleeping Rigidbodies.
