### Description
Request permission to use any video input sources attached to the device.
You need to ask permission for access to the camera on iOS and Web platforms. You can project the feed of webcams, integrated cameras, and external cameras onto a Texture, GameObject or RawImage in your application. Use [WebCamTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WebCamTexture.html) to use your camera feed on the texture of an object.   
  
Access to cameras is required especially for the following features: 
  * Augmented Reality (AR)
  * Mixed reality (MR)
  * Gesture-based mechanics
  * Photo or video filters
  * Real-time in-app communication.
