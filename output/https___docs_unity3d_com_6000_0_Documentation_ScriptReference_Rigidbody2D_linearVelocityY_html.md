linearVelocityY; 
### Description
The Y component of the linear velocity of the Rigidbody2D in world-units per second.
The linear velocity is specified as a [Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) with components in the X and Y directions (there is no Z direction in 2D physics).  
  
This property lets you read or write the Y component of the [Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-linearVelocity.html) separately without affecting the X component of the [Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-linearVelocity.html). This can be convenient when dealing with only X or Y directions in isolation.  
  
Additional resources: [Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-linearVelocity.html) and [Rigidbody2D.linearVelocityX](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-linearVelocityX.html).
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
// Ensure that the maximum vertical speed moving up isn't larger than the configurable value.
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public float MaximumVerticalSpeed = 2f;  
  
    private Rigidbody2D[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) rb;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html)>();
    }  
  
    void FixedUpdate[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
    {
        // Clamp the vertical speed.
        if (rb.linearVelocityY > MaximumVerticalSpeed)
        {
            rb.linearVelocityY = MaximumVerticalSpeed;
        }
    }
}
```
