### Description
Plays video content onto a target.
Content can be either a [VideoClip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoClip.html) imported asset or a URL such as `file://` or `http://`. Video content will be projected onto one of the supported targets, such as camera background or [RenderTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html). If the video content includes transparency, this transparency will be present in the target, allowing objects behind the video target to be visible. When the data [VideoPlayer.source](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-source.html) is set to URL, the audio and video description of what is being played will only be initialized once the [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) preparation is completed. You can test this with [VideoPlayer.isPrepared](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-isPrepared.html).  
  
Refer to [Video file compatibility](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VideoSources-FileCompatibility.html) for more information on supported video file formats.  
  
**The following demonstrates a few features of the VideoPlayer:**

        // Start playback. This means the VideoPlayer[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) may have to prepare (reserve
        // resources, pre-load a few frames, etc.). To better control the delays
        // associated with this preparation one can use videoPlayer.Prepare() along with
