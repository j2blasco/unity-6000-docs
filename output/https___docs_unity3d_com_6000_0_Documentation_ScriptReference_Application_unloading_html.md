### Description
Unity raises this event when the Player is unloading.
Add an event handler to this event if you want to trigger events to [Application.Unload](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application.Unload.html) calls. The event is raised after a call to [Application.Unload](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application.Unload.html) is made, right before the unloading starts.  
  
**Note:** The `Application.unloading` event is only supported on iOS, Android, and Universal Windows Platform.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
// Unload Unity when the user clicks the button. Exit is not applied to the application.  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnGUI()
    {
        if (GUI.Button[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.Button.html)(new Rect[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html)(10, 10, 200, 75), "Unload"))
            Application.Unload[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application.Unload.html)();
    }  
  
    static void OnUnload()
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Unloading the Player");
    }  
  
    [RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]
    static void RunOnStart()
    {
        Application.unloading[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-unloading.html) += OnUnload;
    }
}
