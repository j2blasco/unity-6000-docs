# Automatic slicing
Select the **Slice** tool and set its **Type** to **Automatic** to have Unity automatically slice a texture into multiple individual sprites by generating boundaries based on the surrounding transparency of each potential **sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite). For example, you can use **Automatic Slicing** to isolate regularly spaced graphical images in a texture, such as individual [Tiles](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tilemap-ScriptableTiles-Tile.html)A simple class that allows a sprite to be rendered on a Tilemap. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tilemaps/tiles-for-tilemaps/scriptable-tiles/scriptable-tiles-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Tile) in a tile sheet.
After selecting the **Slice** tool from the Sprite Editor **toolbar** A row of buttons and basic controls at the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in various ways (e.g. scaling, translation). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Toolbar.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Toolbar) and setting its **Type** to **Automatic** , the following editor panel appears:
![The Slice Tool properties with the Type property set to Automatic.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/slicing-editor-tool.png) The Slice Tool properties with the Type property set to Automatic.
In this panel, you can set the default pivot for each sliced sprite with the Pivot and Custom Pivot options. If there are existing selections in the editor window before applying the Automatic slicing, select from the following options in the Method menu to choose how Unity handles the existing selections:
Method | Function  
---|---  
**Delete Existing** | Deletes all SpriteRects in the Texture and adds the newly sliced SpriteRects.  
**Smart** | If a newly sliced SpriteRect overlaps with one or more existing SpriteRects, the best overlapping original SpriteRect will have its position and size updated to the newly sliced SpriteRect. This newly sliced SpriteRect will then be discarded.  
**Safe** | Maintains all original SpriteRects. If a newly sliced SpriteRect overlaps with an existing SpriteRect, it will be discarded.  
**Grid by Cell Size** or **Grid by Cell Count** options are also available for the slicing type. This is very useful when the sprites have already been laid out in a regular pattern during creation:
![The Slice Tool properties with the Type property set to Grid By Cell Size.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/slicing-editor-grid-by-cellsize.png) ![The Slice Tool properties with the Type property set to Grid By Cell Count.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/slicing-editor-grid-by-cellcount.png)
The ****Pixel** The smallest unit in a computer image. Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ShadowPerformance.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#pixel) Size** values determine the height and width of the tiles in pixels. If you chose grid by cell count, **Column & Row** determines the number of columns and rows used for slicing. You can also use the **Offset** values to shift the grid position from the upper left of the image and the **Padding** values to inset the SpriteRects slightly from the grid. The **Keep Empty Rects** option lets you keep SpriteRects that donâ€™t have any pixels within them. This is useful for organising sprites created from the texture based on their position in the texture. The **Pivot** can be set with one of nine preset locations or a **Custom Pivot** location can be set.
The **Isometric Grid** option attempts to slice the sprite sheet which has its sprites laid out in alternating rows of half-height diamonds. When sliced, the resulting SpriteRects will have custom outlines and physics shapes corresponding to the half-height diamonds.
![The Slice Tool properties with the Type property set to Isometric Grid.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/slicing-editor-grid-by-iso-grid.png) The Slice Tool properties with the Type property set to Isometric Grid.
The **Is Alternate** option determines if the isometric diamonds are staggered across alternate rows. If set, the top most row is assumed to have its first diamond starting half a pixel size from the left side. If not, it assumes that the first diamond starts from the left side directly.
When slicing with the Grid options, previews of the SpriteRects are shown on the texture to help guide the slicing. Adjusting the slicing settings will update the previews accordingly. The preview SpriteRects shown may not be generated after slicing depending on the method used for handling existing SpriteRects or the pixel contents of the preview SpriteRects.
![A sprite in the sprite editor with the Slice Type set to Grid By Cell Size. The SpriteRects preview is displayed as a grid of red rectangular outlines over the sprite.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/slicing-editor-preview.png) A sprite in the sprite editor with the Slice Type set to Grid By Cell Size. The SpriteRects preview is displayed as a grid of red rectangular outlines over the sprite.
Note that you can manually edit any SpriteRect generated by any of these **Automatic Slicing** methods to fine-tune the shape of the SpriteRects.
