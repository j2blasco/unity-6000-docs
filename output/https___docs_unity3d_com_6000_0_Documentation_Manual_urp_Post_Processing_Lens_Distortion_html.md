The **Lens Distortion** effect distorts the final rendered picture to simulate the shape of a real-world **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) lens.
## Properties
**Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Intensity** | Use the slider to set the overall strength of the **distortion effect** An audio effect that modifies the sound by squashing and clipping the waveform to produce a rough, harsh result. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-AudioDistortionFilter.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#DistortionEffect).  
**X Multiplier** | Use the slider to set the distortion intensity on the x-axis. This value acts as a multiplier so you can set this value to 0 to disable distortion on this axis,  
**Y Multiplier** | Use the slider to set the distortion intensity on the y-axis. This value acts as a multiplier so you can set this value to 0 to disable distortion on this axis,  
**Center** | Set the center point of the distortion effect on the screen.  
**Scale** | Use the slider to set the value for global screen scaling. This zooms the render to hide the borders of the screen. When you use a high distortion, **pixels** The smallest unit in a computer image. Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ShadowPerformance.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#pixel) on the borders of the screen can break because they rely on information from pixels outside the screen boundaries that donâ€™t exist. This property is useful for hiding these broken pixels around the screen border.
