text; 
### Description
The text contents of the file as a string. (Read Only)
Encodings are detected and interpreted automatically. Supported encodings are: 
  * UTF-32 Big or Little Endian with a byte order mark,
  * UTF-16 Big or Little Endian with a byte order mark,
  * UTF-8 with a byte order mark,
  * UTF-8 without a byte order mark. This encoding is used as a fallback, if the above encodings can't decode the file without missing characters.


To use a specific encoding to decode a file, use [TextAsset.bytes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextAsset-bytes.html) and C# encoding classes.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    TextAsset[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextAsset.html) asset;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)(asset.text);
    }
}
