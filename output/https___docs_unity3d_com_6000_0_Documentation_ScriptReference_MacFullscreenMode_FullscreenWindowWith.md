### Description
Fullscreen window with Dock and Menu bar.
Same as Fullscreen window mode, but Unity will also show the Menu bar and Dock if the cursor moves to the edges of the screen, like other macOS fullscreen Apps. It is possible to switch between fullscreen and windowed modes using the fullscreen button in the window title bar (or in the menu bar in fullscreen mode), and it is possible to switch to other Applications using trackpad swipes or Cmd-Tab.
