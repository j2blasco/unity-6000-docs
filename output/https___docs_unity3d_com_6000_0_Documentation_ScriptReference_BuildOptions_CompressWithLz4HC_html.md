### Description
Use chunk-based LZ4 high-compression when building the Player.
This property functions the same way as [BuildOptions.CompressWithLz4](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildOptions.CompressWithLz4.html), but uses a slower and higher quality compression algorithm.
