[UIElements.BindingSourceSelectionMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.BindingSourceSelectionMode.html) bindingSourceSelectionMode; 
### Description
This property controls whether every element in the list will get its data source setup automatically to the correct item in the collection's source. 
When set to `AutoAssign`, the bind callbacks don't need to be specified, since bindings can be used to fill the elements.
