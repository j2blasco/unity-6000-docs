## Declaration
public static bool SupportsRandomWriteOnRenderTextureFormat([RenderTextureFormat](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureFormat.html) format); 
### Description
This has the same functionality as [SystemInfo.SupportsRandomWriteOnRenderTextureFormat](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo.SupportsRandomWriteOnRenderTextureFormat.html). At the moment, the Device Simulator doesn't support simulation of this method.
