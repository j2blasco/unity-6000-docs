# Scene view grid snapping
You can use the visual grid in the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) view to precisely align **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) by snapping (moving) them to the nearest grid location.
The **Scene view** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SceneView) grid can be customized in many ways. You can choose which color the grid displays in, which axis to display the grid on, and how transparent or opaque the grid lines appear. You can also change the size of the grid lines and how GameObjects snap to the grid.
Many of Scene view grid actions support keyboard shortcuts. You can refer to which key combinations are assigned to these actions and use the [Shortcuts Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ShortcutsManager.html) to customize them.
