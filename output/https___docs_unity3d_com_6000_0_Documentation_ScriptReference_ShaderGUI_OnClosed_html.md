## Declaration
public void OnClosed([Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html) material); 
### Description
This method is called when the ShaderGUI is being closed.
A common reason for this is when a new shader is assigned to a material. The callback is called immediately before the new shader is assigned.
