## Declaration
public void IncrementUpdateCount(); 
### Description
Increment the update counter.
Call this method when you update a Texture from the GPU side, or you want to explicitly increment the counter.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class RenderSomething
{
    RenderTexture[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html) m_RT;  
  
    void Awake()
    {
        m_RT = new RenderTexture[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html)(512, 512, 0);
    }  
  
    public void Render(Texture[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.html) source)
    {
        Graphics.Blit[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.Blit.html)(source, m_RT);
        // We updated the render target on the GPU, so increment the update counter
        m_RT.IncrementUpdateCount();
    }
}

```
