supportsMultisampleAutoResolve; 
### Description
Returns true if multisampled textures are resolved automatically
Some platforms support multisampling without using an intermediate multisampled texture that needs to be explicitly resolved. Such platforms automatically resolve the multisampling which provides a performance gain by saving bandwidth.
