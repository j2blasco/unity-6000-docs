### Description
Queries whether the [Frame Debugger](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/FrameDebugger.html) is enabled.
Most common use case is to pause or disable some rendering techniques or effects that alter their behavior every frame. For example, various graphics techniques that jitter the camera projection every frame would likely benefit from disabling the jitter while the Frame Debugger is active.
