### Description
Add this function to a subclass to get a notification just before a SpeedTree asset (.spm file) is imported.
This function behaves much like [OnPreprocessModel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessModel.html) where you can control the SpeedTree asset import settings through code.
