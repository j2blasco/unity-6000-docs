## Declaration
public void SetBounciness(int i, float bounciness); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
i | Index of the contact point.  
bounciness | Bounciness value for the specified contact point.  
### Description
Set the restitution value for the specified contact point in this contact pair.
Restitution value specifies how bouncy the surfaces at the specified contact point are.  
  
Bounciness of 0 means absolutely not bouncy at all (all the kinetic energy is lost at contact). A value of 1 means all the kinetic energy (and then some due to computational errors) will be conserved. Because of that, normally, bounciness is somewhere in between 0 and 1.
