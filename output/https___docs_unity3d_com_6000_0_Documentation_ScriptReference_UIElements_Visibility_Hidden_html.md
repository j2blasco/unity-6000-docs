### Description
The VisualElement is hidden. Hidden VisualElements will take up space in their parent layout if their positionType is set to PositionType.Relative. Use the [DisplayStyle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.DisplayStyle.html) style property to both hide and remove a VisualElement from the parent VisualElement layout. Note, this is the enum value used when setting styles via VisualElement.style.visibility. In C#, you can just use VisualElement.visible = false.
