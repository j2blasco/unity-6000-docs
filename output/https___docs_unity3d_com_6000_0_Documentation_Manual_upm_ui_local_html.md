# Install a UPM package from a local folder
The Package Manager can load a **UPM package** A **Package** managed by the **Unity Package Manager**. Refer to **Packages**.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#UPMpackage) from anywhere on your computer even if you saved it outside your Unity project folder (for example, if you have a package called **com.unity.my-local-package** and you save it on the `Desktop` but your Unity project is under the `Documents` folder).
You can also use a folder inside your project folder, provided that it is not one of the [reserved project sub-folders](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-local.html#PkgLocation).
To install a UPM package from your local disk:
  1. Open the [Package Manager window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-access.html), if itâ€™s not already open.
  2. Click the **install** ![](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/iconAdd.png) button in the toolbar. The options for installing packages appear.

  3. Select **Install package from disk** from the install menu to bring up a file browser.
  4. Navigate to the folder root of your **local package**.
  5. Double-click the `package.json` file in the file browser.


The file browser closes, and the package now appears in the [package list](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-list.html) with the ![](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/iconLocal.png) label.

Remember that if you updated to the registry version but you made changes locally to your project, the registry version will overwrite your local changes.
## Local packages inside your project
You can place a local package anywhere inside your project except under these folders:
**Project folder:** | **Reason:**  
---|---  
`Assets` | If you place a package inside this folder, the Asset Database imports any assets under this folder twice: once as assets and once as package contents.  
`Library` | Do not modify the contents of this folder.  
`ProjectSettings` | This folder is for [settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/comp-ManagerGroup.html) assets only.  
`Packages` | If you place a package under this folder, the Package Manager automatically interprets it as an **Embedded package** An _embedded_ package is a mutable package that you store under the `Packages` directory at the root of a Unity project. This differs from most packages which you download from a package server and are immutable. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-concepts.html#Embedded)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Embeddedpackage), regardless of the reference in the **project manifest** Each Unity project has a _project manifest_ , which acts as an entry point for the Package Manager. This file must be available in the `<project>/Packages` directory. The Package Manager uses it to configure many things, including a list of dependencies for that project, as well as any package repository to query for packages. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Projectmanifest).
