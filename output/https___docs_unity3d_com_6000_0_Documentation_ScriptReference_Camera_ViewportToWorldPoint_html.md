## Declaration
public [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) ViewportToWorldPoint([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) position); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
position | The 3d vector in Viewport space.  
### Returns
**Vector3** The 3d vector in World space. 
### Description
Transforms `position` from viewport space into world space.
Viewport space is normalized and relative to the camera. The bottom-left of the viewport is (0,0); the top-right is (1,1). The z position is in world units from the camera.  
  
Note that [ViewportToWorldPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.ViewportToWorldPoint.html) transforms an x-y screen position into a x-y-z position in 3D space.  
  
Provide the function with a vector where the x-y components of the vector are the screen coordinates and the z component is the distance of the resulting plane from the camera.
