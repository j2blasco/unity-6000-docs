## Declaration
public void OnInspectorGUI(); 
### Description
Implement this function to make a custom inspector.
Inside this function you can add your own custom IMGUI based GUI for the inspector of a specific object class.  
  
**Note:** This function has to be overridden in order to work.  
  
Additional resources: [Editor.DrawDefaultInspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.DrawDefaultInspector.html).  
  
The example below shows how a custom label can be created by using `override`:
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);  
  
// Creates a custom Label[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Label.html) on the inspector for all the scripts named ScriptName
// Make sure you have a ScriptName script in your
// project, else this will not work.
[CustomEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CustomEditor.html)(typeof(ScriptName))]
public class TestOnInspector : Editor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.html)
{
    public override void OnInspectorGUI()
    {
        GUILayout.Label[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUILayout.Label.html) ("This is a Label[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Label.html) in a Custom Editor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.html)");
    }
}

```
