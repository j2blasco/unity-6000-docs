### Description
Gets the character entered. 
This is the character entered when a key is pressed, taking into account the current keyboard layout. For example, pressing the "A" key causes this property to return either "a" or "A", depending on whether the Shift key is pressed at the time. The Shift key itself does not produce a character. When pressed, it returns an empty string.
