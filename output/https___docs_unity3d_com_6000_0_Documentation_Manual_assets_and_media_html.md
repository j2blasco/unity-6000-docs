Introduction to assets in Unity
# Assets and media
An asset is any file you use in your project such as 3D models, textures, audio files, and **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts). Understand how to manage, import, and optimize assets, with Unity’s tools and workflows.

**[Caching assets](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/importing-caching-assets.html)** | Use the Unity **Accelerator** The Unity Accelerator is an external tool that provides an asset cache that keeps copies of a team’s imported assets. The goal of the Accelerator is to speed up teamwork and reduce iteration time by coordinating asset sharing so that you don’t need to reimport portions of your project. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UnityAccelerator.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Accelerator) cache server improve performance in team environments.

**[Distribute assets as packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetPackages.html)** | Share assets between Unity projects with **asset packages** A collection of files and data from Unity projects, or elements of projects, which are compressed and stored in one file, similar to Zip files, with the `.unitypackage` extension. Asset packages are a handy way of sharing and re-using Unity projects and collections of assets. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetPackages.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Assetpackage).
