# State Machine Solo and Mute
In complex **state machines** The set of states in an Animator Controller that a character or animated GameObject can be in, along with a set of transitions between those states and a variable to remember the current state. The states available will depend on the type of gameplay, but typical states include things like idling, walking, running and jumping. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/StateMachineBasics.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#StateMachine), it is useful to preview the operation of some parts of the machine separately. For this, you can use the **Mute** and **Solo** functionality: 
  * **Mute** disables a transition.
  * **Solo** plays only that transition.


You can set up multiple **Solo** transitions to play only those that have Solo enabled. If one transition has **Solo** enabled, Unity enables **Mute** on the other transitions. If both **Solo** and **Mute** are enabled, then **Mute** takes precedence.
You can set up **Mute** and **Solo** states either from the **Transition Inspector** , or the **State Inspector** , which provides an overview of all transitions from that state.
![In the State Inspector, transitions from State 0 to State A and State B are Solo. Transitions from State 0 to State C and State D are muted.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/MecanimSoloMuteInspector.png) In the State Inspector, transitions from State 0 to State A and State B are Solo. Transitions from State 0 to State C and State D are muted. ![In the Animator window, green transition arrows indicate solo states. Red transition arrows indicate muted states.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/MecanimSoloMuteGraph.png) In the Animator window, green transition arrows indicate solo states. Red transition arrows indicate muted states.
In the example above, if you are in `State 0`, only transitions to `State A` and `State B` are available. The muted transitions, `State C` and `State D`, are disabled.
Known issues:
  * The Controller graph doesnâ€™t always reflect the internal Mute states of the engine.
