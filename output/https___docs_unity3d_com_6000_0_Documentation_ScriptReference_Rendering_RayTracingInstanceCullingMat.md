deniedShaderPasses; 
### Description
An array of Shader Pass names used by [RayTracingAccelerationStructure.CullInstances](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RayTracingAccelerationStructure.CullInstances.html) to ignore Renderers or individual sub-meshes.
If a Shader contains a Shader Pass from the list then the acceleration structure will ignore the Renderer or the sub-mesh using the Shader.
