spriteTessellationDetail; 
### Description
The tessellation detail to be used for generating the mesh for the associated sprite if the SpriteMode is set to `Single`. For Multiple sprites, use the SpriteEditor to specify the value per sprite. Valid values are in the range [0-1], with higher values generating a tighter mesh. A default of -1 will allow Unity to determine the value automatically.
