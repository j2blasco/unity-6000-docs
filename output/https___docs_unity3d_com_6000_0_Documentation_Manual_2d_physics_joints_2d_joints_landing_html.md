Introduction to 2D joints
# 2D joints
Approaches and techniques for working with 2D **joints** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint) in Unity.

[Fixed Joint 2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/fixed-joint-2d-landing.html)A 2D joint type which is completely constrained, allowing two objects to be held together. Implemented as a spring so some small motion may still occur. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/fixed-joint-2d-reference.html)

[Hinge Joint 2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/hinge-joint-2d-landing.html) | Techinques and resources for working with **Hinge Joint** A joint that groups together two Rigidbody components, constraining them to move like they are connected by a hinge. It is perfect for doors, but can also be used to model chains, pendulums and so on. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-HingeJoint.html)

[Relative Joint 2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/relative-joint-2d-landing.html)A 2D joint that allows two game objects controlled by Rigidbody physics to maintain in a position based on each otherâ€™s location. Use this joint to keep two objects offset from each other, at a position and angle you decide [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/relative-joint-2d-reference.html)
