[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) chunkCullingBounds; 
### Description
Bounds used for culling of [Tilemap](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Tilemaps.Tilemap.html) chunks.
These bounds extend the boundary of Tilemap chunks and are used for culling. This helps to ensure that oversized Sprites will not be clipped during culling for the [TilemapRenderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Tilemaps.TilemapRenderer.html).
