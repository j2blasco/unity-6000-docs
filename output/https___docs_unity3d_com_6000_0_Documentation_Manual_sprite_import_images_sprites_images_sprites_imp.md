# Images as sprites import process
Sprites are a type of [asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetWorkflow.html)Any media or data that can be used in your game or project. An asset may come from a file created outside of Unity, such as a 3D Model, an audio file or an image. You can also create some asset types in Unity, such as an Animator Controller, an Audio Mixer or a Render Texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetWorkflow.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Asset) you can use in your 2D Unity project. This section shows how to import images as [sprites](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite).
You can import images into your project through two main methods:
  * [Place images directly into your projectâ€™s `Assets` folder.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/import-images-sprites/place-images-directly-project-folder.html)
  * [Import images into Unity through the Editor menu.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/import-images-sprites/import-image-editor-menu.html)


If you create your project with the [2D template](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/Templates.html) or set the project to [2D mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2DAnd3DModeSettings.html), Unity automatically imports images as the [Sprite (2D and UI)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/texture-type-sprite.html) **Texture Type**. If you set your project mode to 3D instead, Unity imports your image as a texture.
## Prerequisites
To adjust the import settings for images imported as the [Sprite (2D and UI)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/texture-type-sprite.html), you must install the [2D Sprite](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.sprite@latest) package. You will be given the option to install the package if you select the **Sprite (2D and UI) Texture Type** without the package installed.
