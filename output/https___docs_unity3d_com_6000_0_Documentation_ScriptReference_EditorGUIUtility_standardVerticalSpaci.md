standardVerticalSpacing; 
### Description
Get the height used by default for vertical spacing between controls.
When creating GUI without GUILayout, such as is for instance required by [PropertyDrawer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PropertyDrawer.html)s, and you need to place several controls under each other, you can use standardVerticalSpacing to ensure there's the proper standard spacing between the controls. This is advisable over hardcoding specific pixel values. Additional resources: [EditorGUILayout.GetControlRect](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorGUILayout.GetControlRect.html).
