public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Example()
    {
        // Dont use gravity on this cloth regardless if is Interactive or Skinned.
        transform.GetComponent<Cloth[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Cloth.html)>().useGravity = false;
