# Add a Sprite Renderer to an existing GameObject
The ****Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) Renderer** component renders the **Sprite** and controls how it visually appears in a **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) for both [2D and 3D projects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2Dor3D.html).
When you create a sprite (**GameObject > 2D Object > Sprite**), Unity automatically creates a GameObject with the **Sprite Renderer** component attached. You can also add the component to an existing GameObject via the **Components** menu (**Component > Rendering > Sprite Renderer**).
