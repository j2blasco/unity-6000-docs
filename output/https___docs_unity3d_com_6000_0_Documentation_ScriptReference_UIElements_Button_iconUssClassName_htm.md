### Description
The USS class name for Button elements with an icon. 
Unity adds this USS class to an instance of the Button element if the instance's [Button.iconImage](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Button-iconImage.html) property contains a valid Texture. Any styling applied to this class affects every button with an icon located beside, or below the stylesheet in the visual tree.
