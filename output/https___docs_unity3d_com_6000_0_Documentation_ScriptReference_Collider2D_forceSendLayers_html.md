[LayerMask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LayerMask.html) forceSendLayers; 
### Description
The Layers that this [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) is allowed to send forces to during a Collision contact with another [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html).
When a collision occurs between two [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html), both Colliders would normally apply a force to each other that separates them. Both Colliders have a Layer assigned to them respectively, which can be the same or different Layer(s). For the forces to apply, each Collider must send a force to the Layer that is assigned to the other Collider, while also receiving a force on their own Layer from the other Collider. Thus, both Colliders must mutually agree on which Layers the forces are being sent and received.  
  
The [forceSendLayers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D-forceSendLayers.html) property allows you to select which Layers that the Collider sends a force to, while [forceReceiveLayers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D-forceReceiveLayers.html) allows you to select which Layers the Collider receives a force from.  
  
**NOTES** : 
  * Because forces only relate to a Collision contact, this features does not apply when either [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) is set to be a trigger via [Collider2D.isTrigger](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D-isTrigger.html) and does not affect mutual forces applied by a [Joint2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.html).
  * Any [Rigidbody2D.bodyType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-bodyType.html) can send forces; however, only a [Dynamic Body Type](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyType2D.Dynamic.html) can receive forces. Neither [Kinematic Body Type](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyType2D.Kinematic.html) nor [Static Body Type](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyType2D.Static.html) can receive forces.
  * Forces being sent and received do not affect Collision callbacks which are still called even if no forces are applied.
  * During a Collision callback, any impulses reported by [ContactPoint2D.normalImpulse](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ContactPoint2D-normalImpulse.html) or [ContactPoint2D.tangentImpulse](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ContactPoint2D-tangentImpulse.html) will be the impulses that would have been applied if [forceSendLayers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D-forceSendLayers.html) and [forceReceiveLayers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D-forceReceiveLayers.html) were not used.
