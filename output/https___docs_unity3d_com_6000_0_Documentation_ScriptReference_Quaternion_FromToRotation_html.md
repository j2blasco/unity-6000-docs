## Declaration
public static [Quaternion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) FromToRotation([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) fromDirection, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) toDirection); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
fromDirection | A non-unit or unit vector representing a direction axis to rotate.  
toDirection | A non-unit or unit vector representing the target direction axis.  
### Returns
**Quaternion** A unit quaternion which rotates from `fromDirection` to `toDirection`. 
### Description
Creates a rotation from `fromDirection` to `toDirection`.
Use this method to rotate a transform so that one of its axes, such as the y-axis, follows the target direction, `toDirection`, in world space.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        // Sets the rotation so that the transform's y-axis goes along the global y-axis and the transform's z-axis goes along the global z-axis
        transform.rotation *= Quaternion.FromToRotation[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.FromToRotation.html)(transform.up, Vector3.up[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-up.html));
        transform.rotation *= Quaternion.FromToRotation[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.FromToRotation.html)(transform.forward, Vector3.forward[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-forward.html));
    }
}
