# Using the Built-In Render Pipeline
![A scene from Adam, a short film created with the Built-In Render Pipeline. A robot studies its hand and arm.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/Adam.jpg) A scene from [Adam](https://unity.com/demos/adam), a short film created with the Built-In Render Pipeline. A robot studies its hand and arm.
Unity’s Built-in Render Pipeline is Unity’s older render pipeline. It’s not based on the Scriptable Render Pipeline, but you can configure it by choosing between different [rendering paths](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderingPaths.html)The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#RenderingPath), and extend its functionality with [command buffers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GraphicsCommandBuffers.html) and [callbacks](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/execution-order.html).

[Hardware requirements](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderTech-HardwareRequirements.html) | Learn about general hardware requirements for the Built-In Render Pipeline, and requirements for realtime shadows, **post-processing** A process that improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field.

[Rendering order](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/built-in-rendering-order-landing.html) | Resources for using render queues and sorting behaviours to change how Unity renders **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)

  * [Render pipelines](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)
