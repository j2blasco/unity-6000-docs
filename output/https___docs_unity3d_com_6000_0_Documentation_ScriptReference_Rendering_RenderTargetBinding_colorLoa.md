### Description
Load actions for color buffers.
Not all platforms support load actions. If the platform you are using does not support load actions, [RenderBufferLoadAction.Load](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderBufferLoadAction.Load.html) will be used instead.
