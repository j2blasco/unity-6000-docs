[UIElements.VisualTreeAsset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.VisualTreeAsset.html) itemTemplate; 
### Description
A UXML template that constructs each recycled and rebound element within the list. This template is designed to replace the makeItem definition. 
You can use it along with [BaseListView.bindingSourceSelectionMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.BaseListView-bindingSourceSelectionMode.html) and bindings to have a completely codeless workflow.
