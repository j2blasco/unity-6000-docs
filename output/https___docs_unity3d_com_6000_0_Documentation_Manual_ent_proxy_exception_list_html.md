# Define exceptions on your web proxy
One of the uses for a web proxy is to filter and block certain websites. However, there are situations where an administrator needs to allow certain websites or URLs through the web proxy without authentication.
Administrators define these exceptions in an exception list, which identifies approved or allowed websites that users can access through the web proxy.
Unity users in your environment need access to several URLs, and an exception list enables them to access those resources in the following scenarios:
  * Your environment supports automatic proxy configuration but it doesn’t support basic authentication. Refer to [Endpoints that Unity applications access](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ent-proxy-exception-list.html#endpoints-unity) to allow Unity applications to communicate through the web proxy without authentication.
  * Your web proxy uses SSL inspection and you’re unable to make Unity applications trust the web proxy certificates. Refer to [Endpoints that Unity applications access](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ent-proxy-exception-list.html#endpoints-unity) to allow Unity applications to communicate through the web proxy without SSL inspection.
  * Your web proxy prevents downloading of executable files, or requires user confirmation before downloading executable files. Refer to [Endpoints that download executable files](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ent-proxy-exception-list.html#endpoints-exe) to allow Unity applications to download executable files without user confirmation.


Define your exception list so you can bypass any or all of these situations.
The process of adding exceptions varies depending on your proxy software, but you can typically do it in the web proxy configuration settings or through a web-based management interface. Refer to the help for your web proxy software for details.
## Endpoints that Unity applications access
The simplest solution is to add entire domains for the following resources in your exception list:
  * `unity.com`
  * `unity3d.com`
  * `plasticscm.com`
  * `google.com`
  * `googleapis.com`
  * `microsoft.com`
  * `aka.ms`


If you want to selectively control which subdomains users can access, add items from the following table to your exception list.
**Notes** : 
  * Unless specified otherwise, the protocol type for these endpoints is `TCP`, and the port numbers are `80` and `443`.
  * This table was last updated on March 18, 2025. Refer to [changelog](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ent-proxy-exception-list.html#changelog).

## Endpoints that download executable files
Even if you don’t need to add exceptions from the earlier table based on your environment, add exceptions to your web proxy if either of the following conditions are true:
  * Your web proxy prevents downloading of executable files.
  * Your web proxy requires user confirmation before downloading executable files.


Without adding these exceptions, any operations that require Unity applications to download executable files will fail.

public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com | Unity Hub | Content delivery network to store configurations, such as automatic update, and binaries like the Hub installers.
