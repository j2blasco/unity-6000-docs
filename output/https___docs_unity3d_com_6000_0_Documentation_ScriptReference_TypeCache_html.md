### Description
Provides methods for fast type extraction from assemblies loaded into the Unity Domain.
Use `TypeCache` to access attributes and derived types information. This cache allows arbitrary Editor code to achieve better performance, compared to using System.Reflection, by leveraging a native cached type information.  
  
It is a common use case to extract types marked with a specific attribute, or for classes that extend or implement a specific type, when building or extending the Unity Editor. Iterating types in the current domain is usually a slow operation that scales linearly based on the number of types.  
  
To speed up type extraction, the Editor builds an acceleration table, on the native side, that contains information about type attributes and derived classes and interfaces.
