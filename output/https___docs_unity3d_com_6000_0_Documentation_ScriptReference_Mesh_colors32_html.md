colors32; 
### Description
Vertex colors of the Mesh.
Same as [colors](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh-colors.html), except using [Color32](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color32.html) structure is better for performance.  
  
**Note:** The [Mesh.colors32](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh-colors32.html) array has to be modified or created externally from the Mesh. See, for example, the note on the [uv](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh-uv.html) page.
