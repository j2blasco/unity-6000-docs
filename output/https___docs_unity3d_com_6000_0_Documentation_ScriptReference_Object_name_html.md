name; 
### Description
The name of the object.
Components share the same name with the game object and all attached components. If a class derives from MonoBehaviour it inherits the "name" field from [MonoBehaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html). If this class is also attached to GameObject, then "name" field is set to the name of that GameObject.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) exampleOne;
    public GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) exampleTwo;
    public GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) exampleThree;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        //Sets the name of GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) One.
        exampleOne.name = "Ben";
        //Sets the name of GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) Two.
        exampleTwo.name = "Ryan";
        //Sets the name of GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) Three.
        exampleThree.name = "Oscar";  
  
        //Displays their names in the console.
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("The names of these three objects are " + exampleOne.name + exampleTwo.name + exampleThree.name);
