[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) center; 
### Description
The default orientation of a bone when no muscle action is applied.
The vector value represents the bone's rotation in degrees around the X, Y and Z axes relative to the initial position of the bone in the skeleton. Any muscle rotation subsequently applied to the bone will be relative to this value.  
  
If [useDefaultValues](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HumanLimit-useDefaultValues.html) is enabled, the value of `center` will be [0, 0, 0].
