### Description
When the [Joint2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.html) breaks, call [Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D.html) and then disable the component.
When the joint is disable, no further joint breaking can occur until the joint is enabled again.
