## Declaration
public void Pause(); 
### Description
Pauses the playback and leaves the current time intact.
Use this method to pause the playback of a video. This method sets [VideoPlayer.isPlaying](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-isPlaying.html) to `false`. To play again, use [VideoPlayer.Play](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.Play.html).   
  
If you pause the video when the VideoPlayer isn't prepared, this method triggers preparation and shows the first frame of the video.   
  
If you seek through to a different point in the video and then call `Pause()` before the VideoPlayer finishes preparation, it triggers preparation and shows the frame that was the seek target. For example, if you set [VideoPlayer.time](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-time.html) to `10.0f` and then call `Pause()`, it shows the frame at 10 seconds.
