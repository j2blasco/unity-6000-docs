enabled; 
### Description
Allows you to enable or disable the LODGroup.
When enabled, the LODGroup manages which Renderer(s) to display or fade between based on the [LOD](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LOD.html) settings assigned to the LODGroup. If you disable the LODGroup, it performs no action and all the Renderers in the group become enabled.
