processorCount; 
### Description
Number of processors present (Read Only).
This is number of "logical processors" as reported by the operating system, also commonly called as "number of hardware threads". Note that some CPUs have different amounts of "physical cores" and "logical cores" (for example, many Intel CPUs have 4 physical cores and 8 logical cores in so called "hyper threaded" fashion). This method reports the latter. On Android, it reports the number of active processors.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Prints using the following format - "4" on a quad-core CPU.
        print(SystemInfo.processorCount[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-processorCount.html));
    }
}
