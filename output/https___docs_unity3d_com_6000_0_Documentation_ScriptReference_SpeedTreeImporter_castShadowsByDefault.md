castShadowsByDefault; 
### Description
Gets and sets a boolean to toggle whether the imported SpeedTree casts shadows.
Setting this variable to `true` lets the rendering pipeline use the imported SpeedTree asset in the shadow passes and generate soft shadows for a more realistic final rendering result.  
  
To change this setting for a specific LOD, see [SpeedTreeImporter.castShadows](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter-castShadows.html) and [SpeedTreeImporter.enableSettingOverride](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter-enableSettingOverride.html).
