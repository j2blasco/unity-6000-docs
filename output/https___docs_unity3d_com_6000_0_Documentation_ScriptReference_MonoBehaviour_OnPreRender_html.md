### Description
[Event function](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/event-functions.html) that Unity calls before a [Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) renders the scene.
In the Built-in Render Pipeline, Unity calls `OnPreRender` on MonoBehaviours that are attached to the same GameObject as an enabled [Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) component, just before that Camera renders the scene. Use `OnPreRender` to execute your own code at this point in the render loop; for example, you could change visual settings to affect the scene while a given Camera is rendering. `OnPreRender` can be a coroutine.  
  
For similar functionality that does not require the script to be on the same GameObject as a Camera component, see [Camera.onPreRender](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-onPreRender.html). For similar functionality in the Scriptable Render Pipeline, see [RenderPipelineManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipelineManager.html).  
  
Unity calls `OnPreRender` after the Camera performs its culling operation. This means that if you make a change that affects what the Camera sees, the change will take effect from the next frame. To make a change to what the Camera sees in the current frame, use [MonoBehaviour.OnPreCull](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnPreCull.html).  
  
When Unity calls `OnPreRender`, the Camera's render target and depth textures are not yet set up. If you need to access these, you can execute code later in the render loop using a [CommandBuffer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CommandBuffer.html).
```
// This script lets you enable/disable fog per camera.
// by enabling or disabling the script in the title of the Inspector
// you can turn fog on or off per camera.  
  
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    private bool revertFogState = false;  
  
    void OnPreRender()
    {
        revertFogState = RenderSettings.fog[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderSettings-fog.html);
        RenderSettings.fog[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderSettings-fog.html) = enabled;
    }  
  
    void OnPostRender()
    {
        RenderSettings.fog[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderSettings-fog.html) = revertFogState;
    }
}
