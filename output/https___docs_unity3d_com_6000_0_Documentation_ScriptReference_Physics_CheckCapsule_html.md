## Declaration
public static bool CheckCapsule([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) start, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) end, float radius, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers, [QueryTriggerInteraction](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QueryTriggerInteraction.html) queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
start | The center of the sphere at the `start` of the capsule.  
end | The center of the sphere at the `end` of the capsule.  
radius | The radius of the capsule.  
layermask | A [Layer mask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a capsule.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
### Description
Checks if any colliders overlap a capsule-shaped volume in world space.
The capsule is defined by the two spheres with `radius` around `point1` and `point2`, which form the two ends of the capsule.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Given the start and end waypoints of a corridor, check if there is enough
    // room for an object of a certain width to pass through.
    bool CorridorIsWideEnough(Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) startPt, Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) endPt, float width)
    {
        return Physics.CheckCapsule[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.CheckCapsule.html)(startPt, endPt, width);
    }
}
