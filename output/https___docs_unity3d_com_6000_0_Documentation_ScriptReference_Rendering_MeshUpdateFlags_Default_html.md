### Description
Indicates that Unity should perform the default checks and validation when you update a Mesh's data.
You can use this flag with "advanced" Mesh API, which includes the following methods: [Mesh.SetVertexBufferData](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.SetVertexBufferData.html), [Mesh.SetIndexBufferData](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.SetIndexBufferData.html), [Mesh.SetSubMesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.SetSubMesh.html).  
  
For information about the difference between the simpler and more advanced methods of assigning data to a Mesh from script, see the notes on the [Mesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.html) page.
