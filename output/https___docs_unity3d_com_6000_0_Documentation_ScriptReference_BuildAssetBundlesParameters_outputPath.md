### Description
Output path for the AssetBundles.
This can be an absolute path, or a path relative to the current project. This folder is not created automatically and [BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles.html) fails if it doesn't already exist.
