indirectScale; 
### Description
Multiplies the intensity of of indirect lighting in lightmaps. (Editor only).
The range is 0 through 5. The default value is 1. A value of greater than 1 increases the brightness of indirect lighting in lightmaps, and a value of less than 1 reduces the brightness of indirect lighting in lightmaps.  
  
This setting affects lightmaps generated by both the Baked Global Illumination system and the Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination system.  
  
When Unity serializes this `LightingSettings` object as a [Lighting Settings Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-LightingSettings.html), this property corresponds to the **Indirect Intensity** property in the Lighting Settings Asset Inspector.
