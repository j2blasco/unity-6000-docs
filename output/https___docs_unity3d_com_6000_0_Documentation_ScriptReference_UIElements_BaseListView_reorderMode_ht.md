[UIElements.ListViewReorderMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.ListViewReorderMode.html) reorderMode; 
### Description
This property controls the drag and drop mode for the list view. 
The default value is `Simple`. When this property is set to `Animated`, Unity adds drag handles in front of every item and the drag and drop manipulation pushes items with an animation when the reordering happens. Multiple item reordering is only supported with the `Simple` drag mode.
