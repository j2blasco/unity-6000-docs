[ModelImporterAnimationCompression](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporterAnimationCompression.html) animationCompression; 
### Description
Animation compression setting.
Compressing animations saves space in the built game, but more compression introduces more artifacts in the animation data.
