### Description
A base class of all colliders.
Additional resources: [BoxCollider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BoxCollider.html), [SphereCollider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SphereCollider.html), [CapsuleCollider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CapsuleCollider.html), [MeshCollider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MeshCollider.html), [PhysicsMaterial](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsMaterial.html), [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html).  
  
If the object with the Collider needs to be moved during gameplay then you should also attach a Rigidbody component to the object. The Rigidbody can be set to be kinematic if you don't want the object to have physical interaction with other objects.

[OnTriggerStay](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.OnTriggerStay.html) | OnTriggerStay is called almost all the frames for every Collider other that is touching the trigger. The function is on the physics timer so it won't necessarily run every frame.
