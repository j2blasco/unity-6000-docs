allowDynamicResolution; 
### Description
Dynamic Resolution Scaling.
True if the camera is using Dynamic Resolution rendering and false if it is not. Even if this property is true, Dynamic Resolution is only used if also supported by the current Graphics Device.  
  
**Note:** Dynamic resolution scaling (DRS) changes camera resolution on the fly. This will reduce the GPU workload.
