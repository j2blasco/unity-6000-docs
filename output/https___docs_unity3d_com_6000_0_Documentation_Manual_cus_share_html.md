# Share your package
When you have finished developing your package, you can share it with other users.
Choose from the following methods to share your package:
**Type** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Compressed file** | You can distribute a zip file to other Unity users. That way, they can decompress the zip file to a local folder on their own computer and [install the package from disk](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-local.html).  
**Tarball** | You can distribute a tarball to other Unity users. That way, they can [install the package from the local tarball](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-tarball.html) directly.  
**Git URL** | You can distribute a link to your Git repository, using one of the [supported protocols](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-git.html). Then users can [install your package using its Git URL](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-git.html), because the Unity Package Manager can fetch packages from Git repository hosting services like GitHub and GitLab.  
**Scoped Registry** | You can set up a package registry server to host your package and then publish it to that registry. For more information, refer to [Host a scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-scoped-host.html).  
  
Your packageâ€™s consumers can then configure their project settings to [Use a scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-scoped-use.html) to fetch your custom packages from your package registry.

  * [Asset packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetPackages.html)A collection of files and data from Unity projects, or elements of projects, which are compressed and stored in one file, similar to Zip files, with the `.unitypackage` extension. Asset packages are a handy way of sharing and re-using Unity projects and collections of assets. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetPackages.html)
