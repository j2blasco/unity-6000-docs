public static [Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) Lerp([Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) a, [Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) b, float t); 
### Description
Linearly interpolates between vectors `a` and `b` by `t`.
The parameter `t` is clamped to the range [0, 1].  
  
When `t` = 0 returns `a`.   
When `t` = 1 return `b`.   
When `t` = 0.5 returns the midpoint of `a` and `b`.
