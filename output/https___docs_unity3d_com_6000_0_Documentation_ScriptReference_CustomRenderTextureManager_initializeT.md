### Description
Unity raises this event when [CustomRenderTexture.Initialize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CustomRenderTexture.Initialize.html) is called.
Use this event to keep track of CustomRenderTexture initialization. This is useful if you are writing your own CustomRenderTexture update loop. Additional resources: Rendering.GraphicsSettings.disableBuiltinCustomRenderTextures.
