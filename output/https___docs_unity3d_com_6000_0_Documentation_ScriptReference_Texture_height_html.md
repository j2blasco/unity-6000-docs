height; 
### Description
Height of the Texture in pixels (Read Only).
This value is the height of the Texture at the highest resolution that [PlayerSettings.mipStripping](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings-mipStripping.html) allows.  
  
In the Unity Editor, this returns the height of the Texture at full resolution.  
  
At run time, if [PlayerSettings.mipStripping](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings-mipStripping.html) is disabled, this returns the height of the Texture at full resolution. If [PlayerSettings.mipStripping](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings-mipStripping.html) is enabled, this returns the height of the Texture at the highest resolution that has not been stripped.
