ignoreLayers; 
### Description
Which object layers are ignored by the projector.
See [layer mask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Layers.html).  
  
By default this is zero - i.e. no layers are ignored. Each set bit in `ignoreLayers` will make this layer not affected by the projector.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Projector[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Projector.html) proj = GetComponent<Projector[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Projector.html)>();
        // Make the projector ignore Default (0) layer
        proj.ignoreLayers = (1 << 0);
    }
}

```
