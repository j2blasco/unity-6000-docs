Load assets at runtime
# Scripting with assets
Access different types of assets from your C# code to use or change them as part of your runtime application.
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
**[Load assets at runtime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LoadingResourcesatRuntime.html)** | Use a `Resources` folder to store assets that you can later retrieve and load at runtime using the associated [`Resources`](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Resources.html) API.  
**[Stream assets directly into a build](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/StreamingAssets.html)** | Use a `StreamingAssets` folder to make runtime-ready assets available directly to your built application, bypassing the regular project build process.  
**[Modify source assets from code](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ModifyingSourceAssetsThroughScripting.html)** | Make temporary or permanent modifications to source assets from your runtime application code.
