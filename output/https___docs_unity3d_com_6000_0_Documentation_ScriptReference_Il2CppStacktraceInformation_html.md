### Description
Stack trace information options to choose how much information to include in IL2CPP generated stack traces.
### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[MethodOnly](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Il2CppStacktraceInformation.MethodOnly.html) | MethodOnly will only provide the method name in managed stack traces.  
[MethodFileLineNumber](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Il2CppStacktraceInformation.MethodFileLineNumber.html) | MethodFileLineNumber will provide the method name, the file, and the line number in the file for each frame in a managed stack trace. This matches Mono's stack trace behavior. This may increase the size of the project by a few megabytes depending on the amount of scripts in the project.
