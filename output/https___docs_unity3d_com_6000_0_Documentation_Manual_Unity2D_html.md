Introduction to 2D
# 2D in Unity
While Unity is famous for its 3D capabilities, you can also use Unity to create 2D projects. Use this section to learn how to develop 2D projects in Unity, including how to use sprites, create Tilemaps, and use the 2D physics system in your projects.

Many areas of Unity‚Äôs documentation apply to both 2D and 3D development. This section focuses specifically on 2D-specific features and functionality. Refer to [2D or 3D Projects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2Dor3D.html) to decide what mode to create your project in. Refer to [2D and 3D mode settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2DAnd3DModeSettings.html) for information on how the 2D and 3D modes differ.
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to 2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/introduction-2d.html) | Understand the available features of 2D projects in Unity.  
[2D game development](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-game-development-landing.html) | Resources for creating 2D games in Unity.  
[2D renderer sorting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-renderer-sorting.html) | Understand how renderers determine priority in 2D projects.  
[Sprites](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) | Use Sprites within your 2D game.  
[Tilemaps](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tilemaps/tilemaps-landing.html)A GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid overlay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tilemaps/work-with-tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Tilemap) | Use the Tilemap system to create 2D levels.  
[2D Physics](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/2d-physics.html) | Use Unity‚Äôs physics system to handle physics 2D components.  
[2D game development in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-urp-landing.html) | Understand how to implement 2D lights, 2D lighting effects, and the pixelated visual style in your projects in URP.
