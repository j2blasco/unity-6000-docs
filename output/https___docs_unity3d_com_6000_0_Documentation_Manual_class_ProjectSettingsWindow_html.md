# Use the Project Settings window
To open the Project Settings window, go to **Edit** > **Project Settings**.
The Project Settings window can also display additional categories and settings, based on the packages you install. For more information on package-specific settings, refer to corresponding package documentation.

![A](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/LetterA.png) Use the _Search box_ to filter the list of settings categories on the left and highlight keywords in the details pane on the right.
![B](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/LetterB.png) All settings are organized by category, which appear in the _category list_ on the left. When you select a category from the list, the details pane displays the associated settings.
![C](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/LetterC.png) The _details pane_ displays all available settings for the selected category.
The following table lists the default settings categories that are available in the Project Settings window.
## Find settings in the Project Settings window
To find a setting, enter a partial or whole keyword in the search box at the top of the Project Settings window.
![Limit the scope by entering a keyword in the search box](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/Settings-filter.png) Limit the scope by entering a keyword in the search box
As you enter a keyword in the search box, the category list changes dynamically. For example, if you enter the keyword **mode** , the category list limits its scope to only the Project settings that match this keyword. At the same time, the details pane highlights occurrences of the matching keyword. 
**Tip:** You can use the same procedure for finding and filtering [preferences](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Preferences.html).
