### Description
Whether to enable the Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination system for this Scene.
When this is set to `true`, this Scene uses the Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination system. When this is set to `false`, this Scene does not use the Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination system.  
  
When Unity serializes this `LightingSettings` object as a [Lighting Settings Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-LightingSettings.html), this property corresponds to the **Realtime GI** property in the Lighting Settings Asset Inspector.
