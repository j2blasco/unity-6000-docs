A **render pipeline** performs a series of operations that take the contents of a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene), and displays them on a screen.

[Introduction to render pipelines](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines-overview.html) | Understand render pipelines and **rendering paths** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#RenderingPath).  
[Scriptable Render Pipeline fundamentals](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scriptable-render-pipeline-introduction.html) | Understand how Unityâ€™s Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) works, and learn key concepts and terminology applicable to the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), and custom render pipelines that are based on SRP.  
[Choosing a render pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/choose-a-render-pipeline-landing.html) | Resources for comparing the different render pipelines in Unity, and choosing the right one for your project.  
[Rendering paths in Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/rendering-paths-introduction.html) | Learn about the forward and deferred rendering paths in Unity.  
[Using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/universal-render-pipeline.html) | Use URP, a Scriptable Render Pipeline that lets you create scalable graphics across a wide range of platforms.  
[Using the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/high-definition-render-pipeline.html) | Use HDRP, a Scriptable Render Pipeline that lets you create cutting-edge, high-fidelity graphics on high-end platforms.  
[Using the Built-In Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/built-in-render-pipeline.html) | Use the default render pipeline, a general purpose render pipeline with limited options for customization.
