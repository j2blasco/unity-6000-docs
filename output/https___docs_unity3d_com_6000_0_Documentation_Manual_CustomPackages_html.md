# Create custom packages
The Unity Package Manager is the official package management system for Unity. It does the following:
  * Allows Unity to distribute new features and update existing features quickly and easily.
  * Provides a platform for users to discover and share reusable components.
  * Promotes Unity as an extendable and open platform.


You can use the Package Manager to define project dependencies, resolve package dependencies, download packages, add packages, and integrate content in your projects.
For general information on what a package is and how the Unity Package Manager works, refer to [Get started with packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Packages.html).
## Overview
Packages can contain the following:
  * C# scripts
  * Assemblies
  * Native plug-ins
  * Models, Textures, animation and **audio clips** A container for audio data in Unity. Unity supports mono, stereo and multichannel audio assets (up to eight channels). Unity can import .aif, .wav, .mp3, and .ogg audio file format, and .xm, .mod, .it, and .s3m tracker module formats. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-AudioClip.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AudioClip), and other assets.


**Note** : Package Manager doesn’t support streaming assets in packages. Use the [Addressables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@latest) package instead.
Each package also contains a [Package manifest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html)Each package has a _manifest_ , which provides information about the package to the Package Manager. The manifest contains information such as the name of the package, its version, a description for users, dependencies on other packages (if any), and other details. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Packagemanifest) file that includes information such as the package name, its version, a list of its dependencies, and the URL to its repository.
## Procedure
To create a new package:
  1. Create an empty shell for the package using one of these methods:
     * [Set up an embedded package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CustomPackages.html#EmbedMe).
     * [Set up a local package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CustomPackages.html#LocalMe).
  2. Make sure the layout of your folder structure follows the [package layout convention](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/cus-layout.html) for Unity packages. For example, if you have Editor and Runtime libraries, make sure you store them under the `Editor` and `Runtime` folders.
  3. If your package includes code, make sure the package layout you created has the necessary assembly definition files. For information about creating and defining assembly definition files, refer to [Assembly definition and packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/cus-asmdef.html). For additional information, refer to [Assembly definitions](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/assembly-definition-files.html).
**Note** : If the **console window** A Unity Editor window that shows errors, warnings and other messages generated by Unity, or your own scripts. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Console.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Consolewindow) reports a warning after adding an assembly definition file, save your project, close it, then reopen it.
  4. Add your tools, libraries, and any assets your package requires.
  5. Add [tests](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/cus-tests.html) to your package. Tests are essential for ensuring that the package works as expected in different scenarios:
     * Write all your Editor tests in `Tests/Editor`.
     * Write all your Play mode tests in `Tests/Runtime`.
  6. If you have samples for your package, add them to the [proper samples subfolder](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/cus-samples.html).
**Note** : Packages can contain only samples, but you can also include samples as part of a tool or template package using the same layout and JSON structure.
  7. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file every time you publish a new version. Identify new features, important changes, and major bug fixes in this file. For more details on the chosen changelog format, refer to the [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) documentation.
This step is optional for packages that you don’t share, but strongly recommended for shared packages, so that users know which version best suits their needs.
**Tip** : You can provide a link to an external web page where you host this package’s changelog by setting the [changelogUrl](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html#changelogUrl) property in your package’s `package.json` manifest file.
  8. You can [include licenses and third-party notices](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/cus-legal.html) in the `LICENSE.md` and `THIRD PARTY NOTICES.md` files.
This step is optional for packages that you don’t share, but strongly recommended for shared packages, so that your users don’t misuse your packages or violate any third-party licenses.
**Tip** : You can provide a link to an external web page where you host this package’s licensing and third-party notices. Set the link by using the [licensesUrl](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html#licensesUrl) property in your package’s `package.json` manifest file.
  9. [Document](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/cus-document.html) your package.
**Tip** : You can provide a link to an external web page where you host this package’s documentation by setting the [documentationUrl](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html#documentationUrl) property in your package’s `package.json` manifest file.
  10. [Share](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/cus-share.html) your package.


## Creating a new embedded package
Follow these instructions if you want to create a custom package [inside your project folder](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-embed.html).
**Note** : These instructions are part of the larger procedure for [Creating custom packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CustomPackages.html#procedure).
  1. Open the Unity Hub, and [create an empty project](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/Projects.html) on your computer.
You can also use an existing project on your computer, and [embed the package under your project](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-embed.html) or [install the package from a local folder](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-local.html). However, starting with a new project makes the package contents less prone to errors.
  2. Using your computer’s file manager (for example the Windows File Explorer or the macOS Finder), navigate to your project folder and locate the `Packages` subdirectory.
  3. Create a new subdirectory for your package inside the `Packages` folder using a name that matches the [package name](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html#name) and follows the [naming conventions](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/cus-naming.html). For example, if your package name is `com.example.mypackage`, create a subdirectory called `com.example.mypackage`.
**Note** : This is important if your package contains assets, because the [AssetDatabase looks for an asset path](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath.html) that matches `Packages/<your-package-name>/Assets`, regardless of the actual folder name.
  4. Open your preferred text editor and create a JSON file called `package.json` in the root of the package folder.
  5. Fill out all [required and recommended fields](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html#required) in the `package.json` file. You can use the [package manifest example](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html#example) as a reference.


When you reopen Unity, the new package appears in the [Package Manager window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui.html) and in the **Project window** A window that shows the contents of your `Assets` folder (Project tab) [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ProjectView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Projectwindow), where you can view and modify the package contents. If you select the `package.json` file in the Project window, you can also modify its JSON values directly in the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector) window.
Return to the [main procedure](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CustomPackages.html#procedure) to complete the creation of your package.
## Creating a new local package
Follow these instructions if you want to create a custom package outside your project folder.
**Note** : These instructions are part of the larger procedure for [Creating custom packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CustomPackages.html#procedure). 
  1. Using your computer’s file manager (for example the Windows File Explorer or the macOS Finder), create a folder for your package.
You can also use an existing location if you have already created some content for your package.
  2. Open your preferred text editor and create a JSON file called `package.json` in the root of the package folder.
  3. Fill out all [required and recommended fields](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html#required) in the `package.json` file, making sure the `name` property follows the [naming conventions](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/cus-naming.html). You can use the [package manifest example](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html#example) as a reference.
  4. In Unity, create a new project or open an existing project.
  5. Open the [Package Manager window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui.html) and follow the instructions for [installing a local package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-local.html), using the `package.json` file you just created. This step is essential for ensuring the creation of the required `.meta` file.


The new package appears in the Package Manager window and in the Project window, where you can view and modify the package contents. If you select the `package.json` file in the Project window, you can also modify its JSON values directly in the Inspector window.
Return to the [main procedure](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CustomPackages.html#procedure) to complete the creation of your package.
