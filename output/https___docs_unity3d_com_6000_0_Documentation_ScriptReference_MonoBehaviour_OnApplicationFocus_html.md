### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
hasFocus | True if the GameObjects have focus, else False.  
### Description
Sent to all GameObjects when the player gets or loses focus.
[OnApplicationFocus](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html) is called when the application loses or gains focus. Alt-tabbing or Cmd-tabbing can take focus away from the Unity application to another desktop application. This causes the GameObjects to receive an [OnApplicationFocus](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html) call with the argument set to false. When the user switches back to the Unity application, the GameObjects receive an [OnApplicationFocus](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html) call with the argument set to true.  
  
[OnApplicationFocus](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html) can be a co-routine; to do this, use the yield statement in the function. Implemented this way, it is evaluated twice during the initial frame: first as an early notification, and secondly during the normal co-routine update step.  
  
On Android, when the on-screen keyboard is enabled, it causes an [OnApplicationFocus](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html)( false ) event. If you press **Home** when the keyboard is enabled, the [OnApplicationPause](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationPause.html)() event is called instead of the [OnApplicationFocus](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html)() event.  
  
**Note** : If the Editor is in Play mode, [OnApplicationFocus](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html) is called when the Game view loses or gains focus. If an external application (meaning an application other than Unity) has focus, and you click a different Editor tab, ::OnApplicationFocus is called twice in one frame. The first time, [OnApplicationFocus](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html) is called with hasFocus set to true because the Game view regains focus when Unity regains focus. The second time, [OnApplicationFocus](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html) is called with hasFocus set to false because the Game view loses focus to the Editor tab that was clicked.  
  
To minimize the number of times [OnApplicationFocus](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html) is called when the Editor is in Play mode, and you are using the rest of the Editor, drag the Game view into a floating window. 
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class AppPaused : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    bool isPaused = false;  
  
    void OnGUI()
    {
        if (isPaused)
            GUI.Label[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.Label.html)(new Rect[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html)(100, 100, 50, 30), "Game paused");
    }  
  
    void OnApplicationFocus(bool hasFocus)
    {
        isPaused = !hasFocus;
    }  
  
    void OnApplicationPause(bool pauseStatus)
    {
        isPaused = pauseStatus;
    }
}

```
