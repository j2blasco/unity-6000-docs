flipbookColumns; 
### Description
The number of columns in the source image for a Texture2DArray or Texture3D.
When Unity imports a texture with a [textureShape](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporterSettings-textureShape.html) of [TextureImporterShape.Texture2DArray](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporterShape.Texture2DArray.html) or [TextureImporterShape.Texture3D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporterShape.Texture3D.html), it divides the source image into cells. Each cell is imported into its own layer or depth slice of the resulting texture. You can set the number of cells using the [flipbookColumns](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporterSettings-flipbookColumns.html) and [flipbookRows](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporterSettings-flipbookRows.html) settings.
