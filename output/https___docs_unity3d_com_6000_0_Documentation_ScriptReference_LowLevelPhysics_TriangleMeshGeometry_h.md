### Description
Contains the basic geometric shape of a non-convex mesh (sometimes known as a triangle mesh).
The only way to retrieve this shape is to use the MeshCollider.Geometry property to get it from a non-convex [MeshCollider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MeshCollider.html) component.
### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[GeometryType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LowLevelPhysics.TriangleMeshGeometry.GeometryType.html) | Returns the geometry type of this shape, which is TriangleMeshGeometry.  
[Scale](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LowLevelPhysics.TriangleMeshGeometry.Scale.html) | The scale of this geometry.  
[ScaleAxisRotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LowLevelPhysics.TriangleMeshGeometry.ScaleAxisRotation.html) | The rotation of the scale axis of this geometry.
