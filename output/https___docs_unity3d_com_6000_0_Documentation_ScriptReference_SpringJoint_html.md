### Description
The spring joint ties together 2 rigid bodies, spring forces will be automatically applied to keep the object at the given distance.
The Spring attempts to maintain the distance it has when it starts out. So if your joint's start at a rest position where the two rigidbodies are far apart, then the joint will attempt to maintain that distance. The minDistance and maxDistance properties add on top of this implicit distance.

---|---  
[damper](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpringJoint-damper.html) | The damper force used to dampen the spring force.  
[maxDistance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpringJoint-maxDistance.html) | The maximum distance between the bodies relative to their initial distance.  
[minDistance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpringJoint-minDistance.html) | The minimum distance between the bodies relative to their initial distance.  
[spring](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpringJoint-spring.html) | The spring force used to keep the two objects together.

### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[gameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component-gameObject.html) | The game object this component is attached to. A component is always attached to a game object.  
[tag](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component-tag.html) | The tag of this game object.  
[transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component-transform.html) | The Transform attached to this GameObject.  
[anchor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint-anchor.html) | The Position of the anchor around which the joints motion is constrained.  
[autoConfigureConnectedAnchor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint-autoConfigureConnectedAnchor.html) | Should the connectedAnchor be calculated automatically?  
[axis](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint-axis.html) | The Direction of the axis around which the body is constrained.  
[breakForce](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint-breakForce.html) | The force that needs to be applied for this joint to break.  
[breakTorque](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint-breakTorque.html) | The torque that needs to be applied for this joint to break. To be able to break, a joint must be _Locked_ or _Limited_ on the axis of rotation where the torque is being applied.

[enablePreprocessing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint-enablePreprocessing.html) | Toggle preprocessing for this joint.  
[massScale](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint-massScale.html) | The scale to apply to the inverse mass and inertia tensor of the body prior to solving the constraints.  
[hideFlags](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Object-hideFlags.html) | Should the object be hidden, saved with the Scene or modifiable by the user?  
[name](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Object-name.html) | The name of the object.
