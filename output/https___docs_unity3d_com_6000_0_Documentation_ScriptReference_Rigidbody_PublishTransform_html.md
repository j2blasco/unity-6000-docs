## Declaration
public void PublishTransform(); 
### Description
Applies the [position](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-position.html) and [rotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-rotation.html) of the Rigidbody to the corresponding [Transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) component.
This is more efficient than setting [Transform.position](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-position.html) and [Transform.rotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-rotation.html) manually.  
  
Note: This method doesn't update the child Transforms. It should be called from the topmost Transform, down the hierarchy.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class PositionTracker : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    private PhysicsScene[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene.html) m_SomeScene;
    private Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) m_Rigidbody;  
  
    public void SimulateTrajectory(float totalTime)
    {
        m_SomeScene.RunSimulationStages(0f, SimulationStage.PrepareSimulation[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SimulationStage.PrepareSimulation.html));  
  
        for (int i = 0; i < totalTime / Time.fixedDeltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-fixedDeltaTime.html); i++)
            m_SomeScene.RunSimulationStages(Time.fixedDeltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-fixedDeltaTime.html), SimulationStage.RunSimulation[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SimulationStage.RunSimulation.html));  
  
        // Transform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) of the m_Rigidbody is still like it was at the start of the method
        m_Rigidbody.PublishTransform();
        // Transform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) of the m_Rigidbody is now up to date and can be accessed to see where the body ended up after simulating for "totalTime" seconds
    }
}

Simulate a [PhysicsScene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene.html) with a [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) and use [PublishTransform](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.PublishTransform.html) to read the information from the physics system to the [Transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) component.
