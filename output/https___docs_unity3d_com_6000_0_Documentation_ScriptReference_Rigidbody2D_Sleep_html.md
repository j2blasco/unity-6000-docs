## Declaration
public void Sleep(); 
### Description
Make the rigidbody "sleep".
_Sleeping_ is an optimisation that is used to temporarily remove an object from physics simulation when it is at rest. This function makes the rigidbody sleep - it is sometimes desirable to enable this manually rather than allowing automatic sleeping with the _sleepMode_ property.
