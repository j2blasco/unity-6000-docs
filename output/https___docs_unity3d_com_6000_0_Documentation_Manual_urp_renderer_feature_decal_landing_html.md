# Decals in URP
Techniques for using a Decal Renderer Feature or a Decal Projector in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).

[Introduction to decals](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/renderer-feature-decal.html) | Learn about Decal Renderer Features and their limitations.  
[Create a decal via a Decal Renderer Feature](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/renderer-feature-decal-create.html) | Create a decal in your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.
