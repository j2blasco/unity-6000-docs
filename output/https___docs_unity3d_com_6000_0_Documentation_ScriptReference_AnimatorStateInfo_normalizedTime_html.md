### Description
Normalized time of the State.
The normalized time is a progression ratio. The integer part is the number of times the State has looped. The fractional part is a percentage (0-1) that represents the progress of the current loop. For example, a normalized time of 2.5 means that the State has looped twice (2) and has progressed halfway (50% or .5) through its third loop.
