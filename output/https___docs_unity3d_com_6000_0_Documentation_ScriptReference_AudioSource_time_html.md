time; 
### Description
Playback position in seconds.
Use this to read current playback time or to seek to a new playback time.  
  
**Be aware that:** On a compressed audio track position does not necessarily reflect the actual time in the track  
Compressed audio is represented as a set of so-called packets.   
The length of a packet depends on the compression settings and can quite often be 2-3 seconds per packet. Additional resources: [timeSamples](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioSource-timeSamples.html) variable.
