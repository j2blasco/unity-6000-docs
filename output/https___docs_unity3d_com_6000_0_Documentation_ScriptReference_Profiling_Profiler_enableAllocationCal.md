enableAllocationCallstacks; 
### Description
Enables the recording of callstacks for managed allocations.
When enabled, the Unity player saves callstack for each managed allocation sample which is known as _GC.Alloc_. You can see the callstacks in the Timeline View or in the Object Details pane of the Hierarchy View when selecting the _GC.Alloc_ sample.  
  
You must also set [Profiler.enabled](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Profiler-enabled.html) to `true` in order to start the capture.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Profiler.logFile[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Profiler-logFile.html) = "mylog"; //Also supports passing "myLog.raw"
        Profiler.enableBinaryLog[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Profiler-enableBinaryLog.html) = true;
        Profiler.enableAllocationCallstacks[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Profiler-enableAllocationCallstacks.html) = true;
        Profiler.enabled[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Profiler-enabled.html) = true;  
  
        // Optional, if more memory is needed for the buffer
        Profiler.maxUsedMemory[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Profiler-maxUsedMemory.html) = 256 * 1024 * 1024;
    }
}

```

**Note:** Callstacks capture adds noticable performance overhead to the profiling for every managed allocation.
