useLegacyDetailDistribution; 
### Description
Use the legacy pre-2022.2 algorithm for distributing details on terrain.
If set, this uses the algorithm for details distribution used before Unity 2022.2. Only use this if you want exact details placement parity for a project created prior to Unity 2022.2. The algorithm in 2022.2 results in more even coverage, and you can control it more easily.
