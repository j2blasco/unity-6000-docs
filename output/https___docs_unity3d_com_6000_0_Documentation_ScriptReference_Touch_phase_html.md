[TouchPhase](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TouchPhase.html) phase; 
### Description
Describes the phase of the touch.
The touch `phase` refers to the action the finger has taken on the most recent frame update. Since a touch is tracked over its "lifetime" by the device, the start and end of a touch and movements in between can be reported on the frames they occur. The `phase` property can be used as the basis of a "switch' statement or as part of a more sophisticated state handling system.
