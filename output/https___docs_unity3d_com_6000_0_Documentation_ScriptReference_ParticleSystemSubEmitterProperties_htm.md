### Description
The properties of sub-emitter particles.
### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[InheritNothing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSubEmitterProperties.InheritNothing.html) | When spawning new particles, do not inherit any properties from the parent particles.  
[InheritEverything](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSubEmitterProperties.InheritEverything.html) | When spawning new particles, inherit all available properties from the parent particles.  
[InheritColor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSubEmitterProperties.InheritColor.html) | When spawning new particles, multiply the start color by the color of the parent particles.  
[InheritSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSubEmitterProperties.InheritSize.html) | When spawning new particles, multiply the start size by the size of the parent particles.  
[InheritRotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSubEmitterProperties.InheritRotation.html) | When spawning new particles, add the start rotation to the rotation of the parent particles.  
[InheritLifetime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSubEmitterProperties.InheritLifetime.html) | New particles will have a shorter lifespan, the closer their parent particles are to death.  
[InheritDuration](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSubEmitterProperties.InheritDuration.html) | When spawning new particles, use the duration and age properties from the parent system, when sampling MainModule curves in the Sub-Emitter.
