## Declaration
public bool IsTouchingLayers(int layerMask = Physics2D.AllLayers); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
layerMask | Any colliders on any of these layers count as touching.  
### Returns
**bool** Whether any of the collider(s) attached to this rigidbody are touching any colliders on the specified `layerMask` or not. 
### Description
Checks whether any of the collider(s) attached to this rigidbody are touching any colliders on the specified `layerMask` or not.
It is important to understand that checking if colliders are touching or not is performed against the last physics system update i.e. the state of touching colliders at that time. If you have just added a new [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) or have moved a [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) but a physics update has not yet taken place then the colliders will not be shown as touching. The touching state is identical to that indicated by the physics collision or trigger callbacks.
