simulateMouseWithTouches; 
### Description
Enables/Disables mouse simulation with touches. By default this option is enabled.
**Note** : This API is part of the legacy Input Manager. The recommended best practice is that you don't use this API in new projects. For new projects, use the Input System package. To learn more about input, refer to [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Input.html).  
  
If enabled, up to three concurrent touches are translated to state on the respective mouse buttons (example: a two-finger tap will be equal to a right-button mouse click).
