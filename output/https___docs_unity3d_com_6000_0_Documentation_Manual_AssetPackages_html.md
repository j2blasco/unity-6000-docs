# Distribute assets as packages
Asset packages are collections of files and data from Unity projects, or elements of projects, which Unity compresses and stores in one file with the `.unitypackage` extension. Like a zip file, an **asset package** maintains its original directory structure when itâ€™s unpacked. An asset package also has metadata about assets, such as import settings and links to other assets. 
The asset package format is one of the package types supported by the [Asset Store](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions.
