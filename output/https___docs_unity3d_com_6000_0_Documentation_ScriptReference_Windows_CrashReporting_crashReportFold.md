crashReportFolder; 
### Description
Contains the path to the crash report folder on Windows.
Crash reports are stored in the following location:  
  
`%TMP%\CompanyName\ProductName\Crashes`  
  
Crash reports are assigned a unique path on startup allowing you to determine in advance where a crash report will be stored if one occurs.
