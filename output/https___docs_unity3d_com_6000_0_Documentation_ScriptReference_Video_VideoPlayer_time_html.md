### Description
The presentation time of the currently available frame in [VideoPlayer.texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-texture.html) in seconds.
Use `VideoPlayer.time` to achieve the following actions: 
  * Start the video at a certain time.
  * Search through a video.
  * Synchronize a part of your clip with another element- for example, with sounds, visual effects or events.


When you set `VideoPlayer.time`, it initiates a seek operation. For example, if you set `VideoPlayer.time = 10 `, the VideoPlayer: 
  1. Starts to move the video towards the 10 second mark.
  2. Fires the [VideoPlayer.seekCompleted](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-seekCompleted.html) event when it reaches 10 seconds.
  3. Prepares the frame at this time for display.
  4. Triggers [VideoPlayer.frameReady](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-frameReady.html) when the frame is prepared and displays the frame.


The `time` value only properly settles when the VideoPlayer displays the frame.  
  
If you set `time` to another value during this operation, the VideoPlayer creates a new seek operation and adds it to a queue. The new operation will start when the previous one completes.
