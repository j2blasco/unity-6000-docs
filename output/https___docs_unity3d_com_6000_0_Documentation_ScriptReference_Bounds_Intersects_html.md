## Declaration
public bool Intersects([Bounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Bounds.html) bounds); 
### Description
Does another bounding box intersect with this bounding box?
Check if the bounding box comes into contact with another bounding box. This returns a Boolean that is set to true if there is an intersection between bounds. Two bounds are intersecting if there is at least one point which is contained by both bounds.
