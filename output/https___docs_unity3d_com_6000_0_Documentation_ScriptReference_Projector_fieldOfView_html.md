### Description
The field of view of the projection in degrees.
This is the vertical field of view; horizontal FOV varies depending on the [aspectRatio](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Projector-aspectRatio.html). Field of view is ignored when projector is orthographic (see [orthographic](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Projector-orthographic.html)).
