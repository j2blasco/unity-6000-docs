# Set up your 3D panoramic video
Use 3D panoramic videos to create immersive environments in **virtual reality** Virtual Reality (VR) immerses users in an artificial 3D world of realistic images and sounds, using a headset and motion tracking. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#VirtualReality) (VR) or 3D **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene). 
This information covers how to use your panoramic video for 3D scenes or for use in **VR** Virtual Reality [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#VR). VR support is especially useful if your source video has stereo content. 
## Prerequisites
Before you try to set up a 3D panoramic video, you need to:
  1. [Set up a panoramic video](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VideoPanoramic-setup.html).
  2. If your video has a 360° view, [set up a panoramic video as a skybox](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VideoPanoramic-skybox.html).


## Set up your 360° 3D panoramic video
360° 3D panoramic videos provide a fully immersive view of the scene.
To enable your panoramic video for 3D: 
  1. Click on your **skybox** A special type of Material used to represent skies. Usually six-sided. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sky-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Skybox) material (panoramic or cubemap).
  2. Set **3D Layout** to the layout of your panoramic video. For more information on the options, refer to [3D panoramic videos](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VideoPanoramic-introduction.html#3d-panoramic).


## Set up your non–360° 3D panoramic video
For non–360° 3D panoramic videos, a skybox material isn’t recommended. Follow these steps instead: 
  1. Click on your panoramic video’s Video Player **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject).
  2. In the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector) window, set **Render Mode** to either ****Camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) Near Plane** or **Camera Far Plane**.
  3. Set **3D Layout** to the layout of your panoramic video. For more information on the options, refer to [3D panoramic videos](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VideoPanoramic-introduction.html#3d-panoramic).
