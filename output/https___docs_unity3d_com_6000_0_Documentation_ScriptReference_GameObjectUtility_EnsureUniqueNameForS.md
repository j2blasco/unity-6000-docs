## Declaration
public static void EnsureUniqueNameForSibling([GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) self); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
self | The GameObject whose name you want to ensure is unique.  
### Description
You can use this method _after_ parenting one GameObject to another to ensure the child GameObject has a unique name compared to its siblings in the hierarchy.
If the GameObject already has a unique name compared to its siblings, its name will remain unchanged. If the GameObject has the same name as one of its siblings, Unity will rename it to a unique name by using an incremental number after the GameObjectâ€™s current name. This is useful when trying to avoid duplicate naming.
