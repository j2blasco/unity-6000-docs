receiveShadows; 
### Description
Does this object receive shadows?
Usually objects should receive shadows, but turning this off can be useful for optimization purposes, in cases of when you know that no shadows will be needed on this particular object.  
  
Note that receive shadows flag is not used when using one of Deferred rendering paths; all objects receive shadows there.
