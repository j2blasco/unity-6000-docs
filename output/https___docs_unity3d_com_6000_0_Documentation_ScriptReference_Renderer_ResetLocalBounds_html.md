## Declaration
public void ResetLocalBounds(); 
### Description
Reset custom local space bounds.
After you have set up custom local space bounding volume override with [localBounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer-localBounds.html), you can remove it with `ResetLocalBounds`. This makes the renderer use default local space bounding volume.
