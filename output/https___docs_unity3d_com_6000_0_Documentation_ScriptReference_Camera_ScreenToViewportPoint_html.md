## Declaration
public [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) ScreenToViewportPoint([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) position); 
### Description
Transforms `position` from screen space into viewport space.
Screen space is defined in pixels. The bottom-left of the screen is (0,0); the right-top is ([pixelWidth](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-pixelWidth.html),[pixelHeight](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-pixelHeight.html)). The z position is in world units from the camera.  
  
Viewport space is normalized and relative to the camera. The bottom-left of the camera is (0,0); the top-right is (1,1). The z position is in world units from the camera.
