Introduction to physics articulations
# Articulations
A physics articulation is a set of [Articulation Bodies](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/physics-articulations.html) organized in a logical tree, in which each parent-child relationship reflects mutually constrained relative motion.
The main purpose of physics articulations is to provide a realistic physics behavior for industrial and commercial non-gaming applications that involve **joints** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint). For example, they make it a lot easier than the regular Joints to simulate robotic arms and kinematic chains.
You can configure articulations via the [`ArticulationBody`](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html) class, or the corresponding [Articulation Body](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html) component.
