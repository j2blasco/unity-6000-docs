# Optimization
When you make an application in Unity, it‚Äôs important that you analyze and debug it to make sure that its bug-free, optimized, and runs correctly on the target device.
**Topic** | **Description**

**[Memory in Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/performance-memory.html)** | Manage and optimize memory usage in Unity applications.  
**[Unity Profiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Profiler.html)** | Analyze the performance of your application with the **Profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic.
