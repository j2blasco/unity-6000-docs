### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
other | The Collision data associated with this collision event.  
### Description
OnCollisionExit is called when this collider/rigidbody has stopped touching another rigidbody/collider.
In contrast to OnTriggerExit, OnCollisionExit is passed the [Collision](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html) class and not a Collider. The [Collision](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html) class contains information about contact points, impact velocity etc. If you don't use collisionInfo in the function, leave out the collisionInfo parameter as this avoids unneccessary calculations. Notes: Collision events are only sent if one of the colliders also has a non-kinematic rigidbody attached. Collision events will be sent to disabled MonoBehaviours, to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnCollisionExit(Collision[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html) collisionInfo)
    {
        print("No longer in contact with " + collisionInfo.transform.name);
    }
}
