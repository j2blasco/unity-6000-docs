graphicsDeviceVersion; 
### Description
The graphics API type and driver version used by the graphics device (Read Only).
Returns a string identifying low-level graphics API kind and driver version. In most cases when you need to detect which graphics API is being used it is much easier to use [SystemInfo.graphicsDeviceType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-graphicsDeviceType.html).  
  
In case of OpenGL API, the returned string will contain "`OpenGL`" followed by version in "`major.minor`" format, followed by full version string in square brackets.  
  
In case of Direct3D9 API, the returned string will contain "`Direct3D 9.0c`" followed by driver name and version in square brackets.  
  
In case of Direct3D11 API, the returned string will contain "`Direct3D 11.0`" followed by feature level in square brackets.
