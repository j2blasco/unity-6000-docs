### Description
Add this function to a subclass to get a notification just before a model (.fbx, .mb file etc.) is imported.
This lets you control the import settings through code.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);  
  
// Disable import of materials if the file contains
// the @ sign marking it as an animation.
public class Example : AssetPostprocessor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.html)
{
    void OnPreprocessModel()
    {
        if (assetPath.Contains("@"))
        {
            ModelImporter[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporter.html) modelImporter = assetImporter as ModelImporter[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporter.html);
            modelImporter.materialImportMode = ModelImporterMaterialImportMode.None[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporterMaterialImportMode.None.html);
        }
    }
}
