[BoundsInt.PositionEnumerator](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BoundsInt.PositionEnumerator.html) allPositionsWithin; 
### Description
A BoundsInt.PositionCollection that contains all positions within the [BoundsInt](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BoundsInt.html).
Positions within the BoundsInt are not inclusive of the positions on the upper limits of the BoundsInt. This iterator will only return positions of size greater than zero for each axis.

    // and a height, width and depth of 4,
    // and log its contained points to the console.
