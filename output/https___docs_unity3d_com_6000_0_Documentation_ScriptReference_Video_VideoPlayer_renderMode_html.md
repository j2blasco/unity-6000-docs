For example, adding a [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) on a [Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) will result in the [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) initializing its target to be the [Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) background.
