### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
other | The other Collider involved in this collision.  
### Description
OnTriggerStay is called once per physics update for every [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) `other` that is touching the trigger.
**Note:** Trigger events are only sent if one of the colliders also has a rigidbody attached. Trigger events are sent to disabled MonoBehaviours to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions.  
  
This message is sent to the trigger and the collider that touches the trigger.
```
// Applies an upwards force to all rigidbodies that enter the trigger.  
  
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnTriggerStay(Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) other)
    {
        if (other.attachedRigidbody)
        {
            other.attachedRigidbody.AddForce(Vector3.up[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-up.html) * 10);
        }
    }
}

OnTriggerStay can be a co-routine, simply use the yield statement in the function.
