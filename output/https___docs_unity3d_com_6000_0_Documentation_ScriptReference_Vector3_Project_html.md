public static [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) Project([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) vector, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) onNormal); 
### Description
Projects a vector onto another vector.
To understand vector projection, imagine that `onNormal` is resting on a line pointing in its direction. Somewhere along that line will be the nearest point to the tip of `vector`. The projection is just `onNormal` rescaled so that it reaches that point on the line.  
  
![](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/StaticFiles/ScriptRefImages/Vec3ProjectDiagram.png)  
  
The function will return a zero vector if `onNormal` is almost zero.  
  
An example of the usage of projection is a rail-mounted gun that should slide so that it gets as close as possible to a target object. The projection of the target heading along the direction of the rail can be used to move the gun by applying a force to a rigidbody, say.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Slide(Transform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) target, Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) railDirection)
    {
        Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) heading = target.position - transform.position;
        Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) force = Vector3.Project[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.Project.html)(heading, railDirection);  
  
        GetComponent<Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)>().AddForce(force);
    }
}

```
