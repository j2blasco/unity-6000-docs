### Description
Describes a collision.
Collision information is passed to [Collider.OnCollisionEnter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.OnCollisionEnter.html), [Collider.OnCollisionStay](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.OnCollisionStay.html) and [Collider.OnCollisionExit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.OnCollisionExit.html) events.  
  
**Note** : The contact points are in world-space.  
  
Additional resources: [ContactPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ContactPoint.html).
### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[articulationBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-articulationBody.html) | The ArticulationBody of the collider that your GameObject collides with (Read Only).  
[body](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-body.html) | The Rigidbody or ArticulationBody of the collider that your Component collides with (Read Only).  
[collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-collider.html) | The Collider we hit (Read Only).  
[contactCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-contactCount.html) | Gets the number of contacts for this collision.  
[contacts](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-contacts.html) | The contact points generated by the physics engine. You should avoid using this as it produces memory garbage. Use GetContact or GetContacts instead.  
[gameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-gameObject.html) | The GameObject whose collider you are colliding with. (Read Only).  
[impulse](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-impulse.html) | The total impulse applied to this contact pair to resolve the collision.  
[relativeVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-relativeVelocity.html) | The relative linear velocity of the two colliding objects (Read Only).  
[rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-rigidbody.html) | The Rigidbody we hit (Read Only). This is null if the object we hit is a collider with no rigidbody attached.  
[transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-transform.html) | The Transform of the object we hit (Read Only).  
### Public Methods
Method | Description  
---|---  
[GetContact](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.GetContact.html) | Gets the contact point at the specified index.  
[GetContacts](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.GetContacts.html) | Retrieves all contact points for this collision.
