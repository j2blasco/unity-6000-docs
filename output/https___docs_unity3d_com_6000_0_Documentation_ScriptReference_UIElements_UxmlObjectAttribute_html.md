### Description
Declares that a class can be instantiated from UXML and contain UXML attributes. 
A UXML object is a class that can be instantiated from UXML and contain UXML attributes. By utilizing the [UxmlObjectReferenceAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.UxmlObjectReferenceAttribute.html) attribute, you can use a UXML object to associate complex data with a field, surpassing the capabilities of a single [UxmlAttributeAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.UxmlAttributeAttribute.html).
