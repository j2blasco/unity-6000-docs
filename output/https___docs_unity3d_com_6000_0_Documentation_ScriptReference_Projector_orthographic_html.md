orthographic; 
### Description
Is the projection orthographic (_true_) or perspective (_false_)?
When orthographic is _true_ , projection is defined by [orthographicSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Projector-orthographicSize.html).  
When orthographic is _false_ , projection is defined by [fieldOfView](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Projector-fieldOfView.html). Additional resources: [projector component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Projector.html).
