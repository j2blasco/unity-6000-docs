### Description
The current screen resolution (Read Only).
Returns the current screen resolution (read only). If the player is running in windowed mode, this returns the current resolution of the desktop. If you are working with VR devices, use [XRSettings.eyeTextureWidth](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.XRSettings-eyeTextureWidth.html) and [XRSettings.eyeTextureHeight](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.XRSettings-eyeTextureHeight.html) instead.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        print(Screen.currentResolution[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Screen-currentResolution.html));
    }
}
