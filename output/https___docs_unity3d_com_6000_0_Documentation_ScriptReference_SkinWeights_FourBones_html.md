### Description
Four bones affect each vertex. When used to access [Mesh.GetBoneWeightBuffer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.GetBoneWeightBuffer.html) the Bone Weight buffer will contain one [BoneWeight](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BoneWeight.html) per vertex.
