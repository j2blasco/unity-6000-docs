### Description
Source texture is already RGBM encoded in [TextureImporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporter.html).
Use this setting on textures where the texture file already contains RGBM-encoded data. This is useful to make editor display proper texture previews.
