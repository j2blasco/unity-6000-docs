resizable; 
### Description
Indicates whether the column can be resized interactively by the user. 
The resize behaviour of all columns in a column collection can be specified by setting [Columns.resizable](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Columns-resizable.html). A column is effectively resizable if both [Column.resizable](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Column-resizable.html) and [Columns.resizable](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Columns-resizable.html) are both true.
