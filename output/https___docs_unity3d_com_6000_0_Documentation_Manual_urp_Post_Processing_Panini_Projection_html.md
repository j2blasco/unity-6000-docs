This effect helps you to render perspective views in **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) with a very large field of view. Panini projection is a cylindrical projection, which means that it keeps vertical straight lines straight and vertical. Unlike other cylindrical projections, panini projection keeps radial lines through the center of the image straight too.
For more information about panini projection, refer to PanoToolsâ€™ wiki documentation on [General Panini Projection](https://wiki.panotools.org/The_General_Panini_Projection).
## Properties
**Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Distance** | Use the slider to set the strength of the distortion.  
**Crop to Fit** | Use the slider to crop the distortion to fit the screen. A value of 1 crops the distortion to the edge of the screen, but results in a loss of precision in the center if you set **Distance** to a high value.
