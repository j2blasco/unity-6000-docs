animatePhysics; 
### Description
When enabled, the physics system uses animated transforms from GameObjects with kinematic Rigidbody components to influence other GameObjects.
For example, enable animatePhysics to apply velocity and friction from an animated platform to GameObjects on the platform. For velocity and friction to be applied, the platform GameObject must have a kinematic Rigidbody. To make a Rigidbody kinematic, enable the Is Kinematic property in the Rigidbody component.
