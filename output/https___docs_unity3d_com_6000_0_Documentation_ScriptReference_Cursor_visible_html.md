### Description
Determines whether the hardware pointer is visible or not.
Set this to true to reveal the cursor. Set it to false to hide the cursor. Note that in [CursorLockMode.Locked](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CursorLockMode.Locked.html) mode, the cursor is invisible regardless of the value of this property.
```
