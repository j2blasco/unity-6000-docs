## Declaration
public static float GetAxisRaw(string axisName); 
### Description
Returns the value of the virtual axis identified by `axisName` with no smoothing filtering applied.
**Note** : This API is part of the legacy Input Manager. The recommended best practice is that you don't use this API in new projects. For new projects, use the Input System package. To learn more about input, refer to [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Input.html).  
  
The value will be in the range -1...1 for keyboard and joystick input. Since input is not smoothed, keyboard input will always be either -1, 0 or 1. This is useful if you want to do all smoothing of keyboard input processing yourself.

    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        float speed = Input.GetAxisRaw[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxisRaw.html)("Horizontal") * Time.deltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html);
        transform.Rotate(0, speed, 0);
    }

The [GetAxis](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html) page describes in detail what the `axisName` for [GetAxisRaw](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxisRaw.html) means. For example the `Horizontal` axis is managed by `Left` and `Right`, and `a` and `d` keys. Other Input Axes can be seen in the `Edit->Settings->Input` window.
