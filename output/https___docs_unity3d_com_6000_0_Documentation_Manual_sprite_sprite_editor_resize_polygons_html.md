# Resize polygons
Open the ****Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) Editor** for a polygon and you have the option to change its shape, size, and pivot position.
## Polygon shape
![Sprite Editor: Polygon resizing - shape](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/SpriteEditorWindow.png) Sprite Editor: Polygon resizing - shape
Enter the number of sides you want the polygon to have in the **Sides** field and click **Change**.
## Polygon size and pivot
![Sprite Editor: Polygon resizing - size and pivot point - click on the polygon to display these options](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/SpriteEditorWindow2.png) Sprite Editor: Polygon resizing - size and pivot point - click on the polygon to display these options
### Polygon size
To change the polygon’s size, click on the Sprite to display green border lines and the Sprite information box. Click and drag on the green lines to create the border you want, and the values in the **Border** fields change.
### Polygon pivot
To change the polygon’s pivot point (that is the axis point the polygon moves around), click on the image to display the Sprite information box. Click on the **Pivot** drop down menu and select an option. This displays a blue pivot circle on the polygon; its location depends on the pivot option to you have selected. If you want to change it further, select **Custom Pivot** and click and drag on the blue pivot circle to position it.
