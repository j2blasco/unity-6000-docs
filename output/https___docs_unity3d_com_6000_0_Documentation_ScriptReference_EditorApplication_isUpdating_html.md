isUpdating; 
### Description
True if the Editor is currently refreshing the AssetDatabase.
During AssetDatabase refreshing time, the editor checks to see if any files have changed, whether they need to be reimported, and reimports them. The isUpdating property will return true or false depending on whether the AssetDatabase is being loaded or not. (Read Only)
