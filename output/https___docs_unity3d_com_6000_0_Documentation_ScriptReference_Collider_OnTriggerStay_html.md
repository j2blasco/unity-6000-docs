### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
other | The other Collider involved in this collision.  
### Description
OnTriggerStay is called _almost_ all the frames for every [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) **other** that is touching the trigger. The function is on the physics timer so it won't necessarily run every frame.
This message is sent to the trigger and the collider that touches the trigger. Note that trigger events are only sent if one of the colliders also has a rigidbody attached. Trigger events will be sent to disabled MonoBehaviours, to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions.  
  
Additional resources: [Collider.OnTriggerEnter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.OnTriggerEnter.html) which contains a useful example.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Applies an upwards force to all rigidbodies that enter the trigger.
    void OnTriggerStay(Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) other)
    {
        if (other.attachedRigidbody)
            other.attachedRigidbody.AddForce(Vector3.up[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-up.html) * 10);
    }
}

```
