Audio spatializers in XR
# XR audio
You can use 3D audio to enhance the immersiveness of your **VR** Virtual Reality [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#VR) game or application. 3D audio goes beyond typical stereo or multi-speaker audio set ups that typically change only the relative volume of point **audio sources** A component which plays back an Audio Clip in the scene to an audio listener or through an audio mixer. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-AudioSource.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AudioSource) in each speaker.
An [ambisonic decoder plug-in](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AudioDevelopAmbisonicDecoder.html) decodes specially recorded ambisonic audio. Ambisonic encoding is often used for ambient sound sources, sometimes described as an audio **skybox** A special type of Material used to represent skies. Usually six-sided. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sky-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Skybox).
You can use both spatializer and ambisonic decoder **plug-ins** A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Plug-in) outside of VR applications, although they might not have the same fidelity without head tracking.
Refer to the following topics to understand more about audio for **XR** An umbrella term encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) applications. Devices supporting these forms of interactive applications can be referred to as XR devices. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/XR.html)

[Audio spatializers in XR](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VRAudioSpatializer.html) | Learn about **audio spatializer** A plug-in that changes the way audio is transmitted from an audio source into the surrounding space. It takes the source and regulates the gains of the left and right ear contributions based on the distance and angle between the AudioListener and the AudioSource.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AudioSpatializer) solutions for XR projects.
