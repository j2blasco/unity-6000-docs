2D lighting in URP
# 2D game development in URP
Techniques and resources for creating 2D lights, 2D lighting effects, and implementing the pixelated visual style with your projects. 
2D features included with URP are the [2D Lighting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/Lights-2D-intro.html) graphics pipeline which allows you to create 2D Lights and 2D lighting effects; and the [2D Pixel Perfect Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2d-pixelperfect.html) for implementing the pixelated visual style with your projects.

[Precise pixel scaling and rotation via the Pixel Perfect Camera in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2d-pixelperfect.html) | Techniques and resources for using the **Pixel** The smallest unit in a computer image. Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ShadowPerformance.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#pixel) Perfect **Camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)
