## Declaration

### Returns
**bool** True if the device context was initialized successfully. 
### Description
Initialize the device context.
[RadeonRaysContext](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightTransport.RadeonRaysContext.html) implements the [IDeviceContext](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightTransport.IDeviceContext.html) interface. It uses the RadeonRays SDK for intersection testing and the OpenCL 1.2 API for compute. When initializing the context, Unity compiles the compute kernels.
```
          IDeviceContext[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightTransport.IDeviceContext.html) ctx = new RadeonRaysContext[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightTransport.RadeonRaysContext.html)();
ctx.Initialize();
ctx.Dispose();
```
