[Rect](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html) rowRect; 
### Description
Row rect for the current row being handled.
This rect is limited to the visible width of the scroll view. If the TreeView is using a [MultiColumnHeader](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/IMGUI.Controls.MultiColumnHeader.html) then the total width of all the columns can be found by [MultiColumnHeaderState.widthOfAllVisibleColumns](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/IMGUI.Controls.MultiColumnHeaderState-widthOfAllVisibleColumns.html).
