materialsCRC; 
### Description
An array of Material CRC and instance id pairs generated by [RayTracingAccelerationStructure.CullInstances](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RayTracingAccelerationStructure.CullInstances.html) when using [RayTracingInstanceCullingFlags.ComputeMaterialsCRC](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RayTracingInstanceCullingFlags.ComputeMaterialsCRC.html) flag.
The array can be used for example to compute a composite CRC of all Materials and reset the convergence during path tracing if the user changed a Material property or Materials used in path tracing were created or deleted.
