### Description
Support for Texture to RenderTexture copies in [Graphics.CopyTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.CopyTexture.html).
Not all platforms can copy from a [Texture2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D.html) into a [RenderTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html) directly. For example, Direct3D9 currently can not do this. See [CopyTextureSupport](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CopyTextureSupport.html) for an overview.
