[CameraType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CameraType.html) cameraType; 
### Description
Identifies what kind of camera this is, using the [CameraType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CameraType.html) enum.
Regular cameras in your scene have a value of [CameraType.Game](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CameraType.Game.html), both at runtime and in the Unity Editor. Cameras that render different parts of the Unity Editor have other values; for example, cameras that render the Scene view have a value of [CameraType.SceneView](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CameraType.SceneView.html).  
  
This is useful in the Scriptable Render Pipeline, where you can define different rendering behavior for Unity Editor cameras as well as cameras in your scene.
