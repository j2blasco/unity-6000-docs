### Description
Provides a static implementation of [ObjectPool<T0>](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.ObjectPool_1.html).
The GenericPool has collection checks enabled that ensure that when an instance is released it is not already in the pool. Note this is not thread-safe. Additional resources: [UnsafeGenericPool<T0>](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.UnsafeGenericPool_1.html).
```
using UnityEngine.Pool;  
  
public class GenericPoolExample
{
    class MyClass
    {
        public int someValue;
        public string someString;
    }  
  
    void GetPooled()
    {
        // Get an instance
        var instance = GenericPool<MyClass>.Get();  
  
        // Return the instance
        GenericPool<MyClass>.Release(instance);
    }
}
