[Build.OverrideTextureCompression](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Build.OverrideTextureCompression.html) overrideTextureCompression; 
### Description
The asset importing override of texture compression.
This setting lets you override the texture compression settings that Unity uses when it imports assets. This is mostly useful for local development, to speed up texture importing or build target switching.  
  
This setting affects all textures in your project, and overrides the import settings for individual textures. For example, if a texture's import settings indicate that a "Normal" compressor quality should be used, but `overrideTextureCompression` is set to [OverrideTextureCompression.ForceFastCompressor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Build.OverrideTextureCompression.ForceFastCompressor.html), the texture will be compressed with "Fast" compressor quality setting.  
  
Overriding the texture compression format can increase the speed of the import process considerably, but it is important to understand the implications. For information on the effects of the different values, see the documentation for the [OverrideTextureCompression](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Build.OverrideTextureCompression.html) enum.  
  
The Unity editor command line argument `-overrideTextureCompression` can also be used to set this.
