### Description
Parameters are used to communicate between scripting and the controller. They are used to drive transitions and blendtrees for example.
It's important to note that the AnimatorControllerParameters are returned as a copy. The array should be set back into the property when changed.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);  
  
class ControllerModifier
{
    UnityEditor.Animations.AnimatorController controller;  
  
    public void ModifyParameters(int parameterIndex, string newName)
    {
        AnimatorControllerParameter[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimatorControllerParameter.html)[] parameters = controller.parameters;
        parameters[parameterIndex].name = newName;
        controller.parameters = parameters;
    }
}

```
