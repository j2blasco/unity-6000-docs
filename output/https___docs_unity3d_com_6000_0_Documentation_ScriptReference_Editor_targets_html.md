targets; 
### Description
An array of all the object being inspected.
For editors that support multi-object editing, you can use the targets property in [OnInspectorGUI](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.OnInspectorGUI.html). However, it is better to use the [serializedObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor-serializedObject.html), as described on the page about the [Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.html) class.
