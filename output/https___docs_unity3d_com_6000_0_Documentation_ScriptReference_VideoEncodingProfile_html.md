### Description
Use the options in this enumeration to change the encoder profile.
H.264 profiles (Baseline, Main, and High) are compression and encoding standards that determine how the [MediaEncoder](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Media.MediaEncoder.html) compresses and encodes video files during recording. You can use the `MediaEncoder` to encode clips and choose the encoding profile via C#. The encoding profile you select influences the compatibility and compression efficiency of the H.264 codec. To record video, you can use the [Unity Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@5.1/manual/index.html), which uses the `MediaEncoder` in its implementation, or you can implement your own custom recording logic to work directly with the `MediaEncoder` API.  
  
For a code example, refer to [H264EncoderAttributes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Media.H264EncoderAttributes.html).  
  
This enum isnâ€™t exposed in [VideoClipImporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/VideoClipImporter.html), so when you transcode video clips to H.264 during an import, Unity uses the baseline profile for maximum stability and compatibility.
### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[H264Baseline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/VideoEncodingProfile.H264Baseline.html) | Encode video with the baseline profile.  
[H264Main](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/VideoEncodingProfile.H264Main.html) | Encode video using the main profile.  
[H264High](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/VideoEncodingProfile.H264High.html) | Encode video with the high profile.
