gameObjectsNotMatchedBecomesOverride; 
### Description
If a GameObject is not matched up then it can become an added GameObject on the new Prefab instance. This property is only used when used together with [ObjectMatchMode.ByHierarchy](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ObjectMatchMode.ByHierarchy.html).
If this property is false then the GameObject will be deleted if it doesn't match a GameObject on the PrefabAsset.
