### Description
The sprite will not interact with the masking system.
This is the default interaction mode for sprites, and all existing sprites will have this value. If the sprite is expected to show some interaction with masks, then [SpriteMaskInteraction.VisibleOutsideMask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpriteMaskInteraction.VisibleOutsideMask.html) and SpriteMaskInteraction.VisibleUnderMask should be used.
