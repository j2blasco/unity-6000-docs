### Description
The JointMotor is used to motorize a joint.
For example the [HingeJoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html) can be told to rotate at a given speed and force. The joint will then attempt to reach the velocity with the given maximum force.  
Additional resources: [HingeJoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html).
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        HingeJoint[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html) hinge = GetComponent<HingeJoint[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html)>();  
  
        // Make the hinge motor rotate with 90 degrees per second and a strong force.
        JointMotor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointMotor.html) motor = hinge.motor;
        motor.force = 100;
        motor.targetVelocity = 90;
        motor.freeSpin = false;
        hinge.motor = motor;
    }
}

### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[force](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointMotor-force.html) | The motor will apply a force.  
[freeSpin](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointMotor-freeSpin.html) | If freeSpin is enabled the motor will only accelerate but never slow down.  
[targetVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointMotor-targetVelocity.html) | The motor will apply a force up to force to achieve targetVelocity.
