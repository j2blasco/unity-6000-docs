public static [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) Reflect([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) inDirection, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) inNormal); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
inDirection | The direction vector towards the plane.  
inNormal | The normal vector that defines the plane.  
### Description
Reflects a vector off the plane defined by a normal.
This method calculates the reflection vector using the following formula: v = inDirection - 2 * inNormal * dot(inDirection inNormal). The `inNormal` vector defines a plane. A plane's normal is the vector that is perpendicular to its surface. The `inDirection` vector is treated as a directional arrow coming into the plane. The returned value is a vector of equal magnitude to `inDirection` but with its direction reflected.
