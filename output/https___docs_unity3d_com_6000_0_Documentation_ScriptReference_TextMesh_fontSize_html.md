fontSize; 
### Description
The font size to use (for dynamic fonts).
If this is set to a non-zero value, the font size specified in the font importer is overriden with a custom size. This is only supported for fonts set to use dynamic font rendering. Other fonts will always use the default font size.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        GetComponent<TextMesh[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextMesh.html)>().fontSize = 12;
    }
}
