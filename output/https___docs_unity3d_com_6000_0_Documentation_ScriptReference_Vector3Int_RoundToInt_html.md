## Declaration
public static [Vector3Int](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3Int.html) RoundToInt([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) v); 
### Description
Converts a [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) to a [Vector3Int](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3Int.html) by doing a Round to each value.
As there is a conversion of float to integer, there is a loss of precision.
