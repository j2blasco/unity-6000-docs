See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#VirtualReality) experiences with Unity’s **VR** Virtual Reality [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#VR) **feature set** A feature set is a collection of related packages that you can use to achieve specific results in the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in Unity’s Package Manager. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Featureset). The VR feature set provides a starting point for VR development, installing all relevant packages necessary to add interactivity to your apps.
## Getting started
The Unity VR feature set pre-installs the packages you need for VR development. With [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/), you can simplify your VR development by targeting a wide range of VR devices. Alternatively, develop directly for the [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/) platform with the Oculus **XR** An umbrella term encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) applications. Devices supporting these forms of interactive applications can be referred to as XR devices. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/XR.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#XR) Plugin.
Unity directly supports the following VR platforms:
  * [Oculus](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-gs-overview/)
  * [Windows Mixed Reality via OpenXR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/unity-development-wmr-overview)


For more information on how to start developing applications for these platforms in Unity, refer the documentation in the previous list.
If you plan to target Valve’s OpenVR platform, you must download Valve’s [OpenVR Unity XR Plugin](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/unity-xr-plugin) and [SteamVR Unity Plugin](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/2.6.0b4) for input.
