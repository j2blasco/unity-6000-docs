[Switch to Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ParticleSystem.html "Go to ParticleSystem Component in the Manual")
isStopped; 
### Description
Determines whether the Particle System is in the stopped state.
This property is true after a call to [ParticleSystem.Stop](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.Stop.html) stops the system, if a non-looping system finishes playing and all its particles die, or if the system has not yet played.  
  
[ParticleSystem.IsAlive](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.IsAlive.html) is also false when the system is in the stopped state.
