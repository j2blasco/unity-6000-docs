### Description
Speculative continuous collision detection is on for static and dynamic geometries
This is a collision detection mode that can be used on both dynamic and kinematic objects. It is generally cheaper than other CCD mode. It also handles angular motion much better. However, in some cases, high speed objects may still tunneling through other geometries. 
```
//This script allows you to switch collision detection mode at the press of the space key, and move your GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html). It also outputs collisions that occur to the console.
//Attach this script to a GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) and make sure it has a Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) component
//If it doesn't have a Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) component, click the GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html), go to its Inspector and click the **Add Component** button. Then, go to **Physics**>**Rigidbody**.
//Create another GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html). Make sure it has a Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html), so you can test collisions between them.
