[Terrain](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Terrain.html) activeTerrain; 
### Description
The active Terrain. This is a convenient function to get to the main Terrain in the Scene.
If you have multiple active Terrains, this returns only one of them. If you need all the terrains in the scene, use [Terrain.activeTerrains](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Terrain-activeTerrains.html) instead. A terrain is active when the component that represents it is enabled and the GameObject it is on is active.
