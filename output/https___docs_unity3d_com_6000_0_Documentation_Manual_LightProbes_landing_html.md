# Precalculating indirect light with Light Probes
Resources and techniques for using **Light Probes** Light probes store information about how light passes through space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged within a given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery within that space. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightProbes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#LightProbe) to store the light at specific points in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene), so that Unity can calculate indirect lighting for **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)

[Introduction to Light Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightProbes.html) | Learn about using Light Probes to store the light passing through specific points in a scene.  
[Light Probes and moving GameObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightProbes-MovingObjects.html) | Understand how dynamic GameObjects sample the light from Light Probes.  
[Place Light Probes with the Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-LightProbeGroup.html) | Choose where to place Light Probes, and choose the right amount of probes if you use **Enlighten** A lighting system by Geomerics used in Unity for Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination.

[Place Light Probes with a script](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightProbes-Placing-Scripting.html) | An example of forming a ring of Light Probes with a script.  
[Set a GameObject to use light from Light Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightProbes-MeshRenderer.html) | Use a **Mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Mesh) Renderer component to set a GameObject correctly to receive light from Light Probes.  
[Load Light Probes in multiple scenes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/light-probes-and-scene-loading.html) | Use a script to control when Unity updates Light Probes if you load multiple scenes.  
[Move Light Probes at runtime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightProbes-Moving.html) | Use the `LightProbes` API to move Light Probes, for example if you create a world by loading multiple scenes additively and moving each scene to a different position.  
[Troubleshooting Light Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/light-probes-troubleshooting.html) | Solve common issues with Light Probes, such as light bleeding and ringing.
