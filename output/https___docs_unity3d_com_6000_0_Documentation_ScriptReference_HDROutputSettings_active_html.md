### Description
Describes whether HDR output is currently active on the display. It is `true` if this is the case, and @@false@ otherwise.
The value of this poperty can change at runtime as a consequence of calling [HDROutputSettings.RequestHDRModeChange](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HDROutputSettings.RequestHDRModeChange.html). It is also possible that Unity can alter this value at runtime when responding to system or application level events.
