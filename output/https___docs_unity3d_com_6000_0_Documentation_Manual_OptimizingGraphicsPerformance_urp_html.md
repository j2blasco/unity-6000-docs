Reducing rendering work on the CPU in URP
# Reducing rendering work on the CPU or GPU in URP
Resources for reducing rendering work on the CPU or adjusting settings to improve performance in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).
**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Reducing rendering work on the CPU](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/reduce-rendering-work-on-cpu.html) | Resources for improving performance by using the GPU Resident Drawer or GPU **occlusion culling** A process that disables rendering GameObjects that are hidden (occluded) from the view of the camera. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/OcclusionCulling.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Occlusionculling).  
[Adjust settings to improve performance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/optimize-for-better-performance.html) | Adjust settings in the URP Asset or the URP Renderer to improve performance.  
[Optimize for untethered XR devices](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/xr-untethered-device-optimization.html) | Use tile-based GPU hardware architecture more efficiently.
