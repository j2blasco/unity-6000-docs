## Declaration
public static void EarlyJobInit(); 
### Description
Gathers and caches reflection data for the internal job system's managed bindings.
Unity is responsible for calling this method - don't call it yourself. When the Jobs package is included in the project, Unity generates code to call EarlyJobInit at startup. This results in the following benefits: 
  * Job initialization doesn't lazily occur during job scheduling, which would increase the time it takes to schedule a job.
  * Burst compiled code may schedule jobs because the reflection part of initialization, which is not compatible with Burst compiler constraints, has already happened in EarlyJobInit.


**Note** : While the Jobs package code generator handles this automatically for all closed job types, you must register those with generic arguments (like IJobFor&lt;MyJobType&lt;T&gt;&gt;) manually for each specialization with Unity.Jobs.RegisterGenericJobTypeAttribute.
