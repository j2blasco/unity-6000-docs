## Declaration
public static void MoveFileOrDirectory(string source, string dest); 
### Description
Moves a file or a directory from a given path to another path.
This function's path is relative to the project root folder but it can also accept absolute paths.  
  
All file separators should be forward ones "/".  
  
Make sure to include the name of the files or directories at the end of the `dest` argument.
