devices; 
### Description
Return a list of available devices.
This queries the system for the list of devices connected and it can be slow. You should cache this value by keeping a copy of the result if you want to use it repeatedly.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Gets the list of devices and prints them to the console.
    void Start()
    {
        WebCamDevice[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WebCamDevice.html)[] devices = WebCamTexture.devices[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WebCamTexture-devices.html);
        for (int i = 0; i < devices.Length; i++)
            Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)(devices[i].name);
    }
