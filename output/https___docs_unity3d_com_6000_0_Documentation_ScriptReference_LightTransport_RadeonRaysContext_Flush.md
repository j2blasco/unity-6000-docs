## Declaration
public bool Flush(); 
### Returns
**bool** True if the flush was successful. 
### Description
Flush the device context.
Start execution of the enqueued operations. On some platforms the underlying implementation or driver flushes automatically, on others it is up to the user to call Flush. The Flush method returns immediately.
```
          IDeviceContext[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightTransport.IDeviceContext.html) ctx = new RadeonRaysContext[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightTransport.RadeonRaysContext.html)();
ctx.Initialize();
const int sizeInBytes = 4;
var bufferID = ctx.CreateBuffer(sizeInBytes);
using var results = new NativeArray<float>(1, Allocator.Temp[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Collections.Allocator.Temp.html));
var readEvent = ctx.CreateEvent();
ctx.ReadBuffer(bufferID.Slice<byte>(), results.Reinterpret<byte>(4), readEvent);
ctx.Flush();
ctx.DestroyEvent(readEvent);
ctx.DestroyBuffer(bufferID);
ctx.Dispose();
