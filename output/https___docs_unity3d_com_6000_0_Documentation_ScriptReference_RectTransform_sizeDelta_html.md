[Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) sizeDelta; 
### Description
The size of this RectTransform relative to the distances between the anchors.
If the anchors are together, sizeDelta is the same as size. If the anchors are in each of the four corners of the parent, the sizeDelta is how much bigger or smaller the rectangle is compared to its parent.
