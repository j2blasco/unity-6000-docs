[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) userAcceleration; 
### Description
Returns the acceleration that the user is giving to the device.
The significance of this value is that the effect of gravity (which is also detected by the accelerometer) has been removed to leave just the acceleration from the user's movements.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) forceVec;
    Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) rb;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)>();
    }  
  
    void FixedUpdate[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
    {
        // Apply forces to an object to match the side-to-side acceleration
        // the user is giving to the device.
        rb.AddForce(Input.gyro.userAcceleration.x * forceVec);
    }
}
