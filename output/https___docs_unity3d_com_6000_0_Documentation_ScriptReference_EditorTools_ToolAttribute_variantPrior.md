### Description
The variant priority defines the order that tools are displayed in when they are displayed in a [ToolAttribute.variantGroup](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorTools.ToolAttribute-variantGroup.html) dropdown.
Tools are sorted in ascending order, with the lowest values at the top of the list.  
  
The default priority is [ToolAttribute.defaultPriority](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorTools.ToolAttribute-defaultPriority.html).
