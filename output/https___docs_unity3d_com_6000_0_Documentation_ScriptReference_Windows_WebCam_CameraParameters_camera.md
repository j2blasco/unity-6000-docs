cameraResolutionHeight; 
### Description
A valid height resolution for use with the web camera.
This value must be set to a valid height resolution supported by the intended capture mode. For example, when using this with PhotoCapture, you will want to query [PhotoCapture.SupportedResolutions](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Windows.WebCam.PhotoCapture.SupportedResolutions.html) for a valid height.
