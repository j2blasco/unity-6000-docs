### Description
The contents of a GUI element.
This works closely in relation with [GUIStyle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUIStyle.html). GUIContent defines `what` to render and [GUIStyle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUIStyle.html) defines `how` to render it.
