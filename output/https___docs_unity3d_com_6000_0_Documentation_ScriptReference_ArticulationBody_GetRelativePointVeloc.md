## Declaration
public [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) GetRelativePointVelocity([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) relativePoint); 
### Description
The velocity relative to the articulation body at the point `relativePoint`.
Gets the velocity relative to the articulation body at the specified `relativePoint`.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public ArticulationBody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html) ab;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        ab = GetComponent<ArticulationBody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html)>();
    }  
  
    // Get the velocity of a wheel, specified by its position in local space.
    // This method assumes that the wheel is a child of the ArticulationBody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html), or that the wheel translates relative to the ArticulationBody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html).

    {
        return ab.GetRelativePointVelocity(localWheelPos);
    }
