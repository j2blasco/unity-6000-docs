[ModelImporterIndexFormat](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporterIndexFormat.html) indexFormat; 
### Description
Format of the imported mesh index buffer data.
Index buffer can either be 16 bit (supports up to 65535 vertices in a mesh), or 32 bit (supports up to 4 billion vertices). Default behavior is [ModelImporterIndexFormat.Auto](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporterIndexFormat.Auto.html), which picks format based on vertex count in the mesh.
