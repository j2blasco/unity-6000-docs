## Declaration
public static void DrawLine([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) from, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) to); 
### Description
Draws a line starting at `from` towards `to`.
If you need to draw many lines consider the [Gizmos.DrawLineList](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.DrawLineList.html) or [Gizmos.DrawLineStrip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.DrawLineStrip.html) functions which are much faster than repeatedly calling this function to draw lines individually.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Transform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) target;  
  
    void OnDrawGizmosSelected()
    {
        if (target != null)
        {
            // Draws a blue line from this transform to the target
            Gizmos.color[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos-color.html) = Color.blue[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color-blue.html);
            Gizmos.DrawLine[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.DrawLine.html)(transform.position, target.position);
        }
    }
}
