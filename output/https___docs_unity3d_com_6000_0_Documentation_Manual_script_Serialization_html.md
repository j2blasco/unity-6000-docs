Serialization rules
# Script serialization
**Serialization** is the automatic process of transforming data structures or **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) states into a format that Unity can store and reconstruct later.
How you organize data in your Unity project affects how Unity serializes that data, which can have a significant impact on the performance of your project. This page outlines serialization in Unity and how to optimize your project for it.
