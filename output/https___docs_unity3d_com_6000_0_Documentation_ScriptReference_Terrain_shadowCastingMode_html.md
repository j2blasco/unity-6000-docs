[Rendering.ShadowCastingMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.ShadowCastingMode.html) shadowCastingMode; 
### Description
Allows you to set the shadow casting mode for the terrain.
[ShadowCastingMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.ShadowCastingMode.html) enum defines how and if shadows are cast from this object. Typically shadows are either cast or not, but it's also possible to make shadows two-sided (useful for otherwise single-sided geometry) or make a shadows-only object (that is otherwise invisible in the Scene, but casts a shadow).
