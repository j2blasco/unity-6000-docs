linearDamping; 
### Description
The linear damping of the Rigidbody2D linear velocity.
Damping can be used to reduce the magnitude of the [Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-linearVelocity.html) (linear speed) of a [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) over time.  
  
Zero indicates that no damping should be used whereas higher values increase the damping, effectively slowing down the linear motion faster. Unlike contact friction, linear damping is always applied.  
  
**Note:** The following formula is how the linear damping is applied: `linearVelocity *= 1.0f / ( 1.0f + simulation-time-step * linearDamping )`
