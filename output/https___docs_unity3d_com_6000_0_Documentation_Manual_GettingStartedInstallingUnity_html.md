System requirements for Unity 6.0 
# Install Unity
The [Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/index.html) is the primary way to install the Unity Editor, create projects, and manage your Unity experience. It provides a central location to manage your Editor installations, accounts, licenses, and projects. For information on installing Unity using Hub, refer to [Install and uninstall Editor versions](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/AddEditor.html).
Apart from using the Hub, you can install the Unity Editor by using the installer files or Unity Download Assistant. During installation, the Download Assistant generates a script and installer files that you can use to install Unity on other computers (including offline computers) using the command line. If you choose to install the Hub later, you can add the previously installed Editor versions to the Hub.
