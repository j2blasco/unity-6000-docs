ignorePlatformSupport; 
### Description
Ignores platform support checks for the selected texture format.
By default, `TextureGenerator` checks if the active build target supports the selected texture format. If you enable this property, `TextureGenerator` ignores that check, and allows you to generate texture data in any format regardless of the currently active build target.
