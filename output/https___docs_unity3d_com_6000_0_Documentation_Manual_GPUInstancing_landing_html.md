Introduction to GPU instancing
# GPU instancing
Resources and techniques for rendering multiple copies of the same **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Mesh) at the same time.

[Introduction to GPU instancing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GPUInstancing.html) | Learn about the GPU drawing multiple copies of a mesh at the same time, for example to draw multiple trees or bushes.  
[Enable GPU instancing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/gpu-instancing-enable.html) | Make sure meshes and **shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) are compatible with GPU instancing.  
[Troubleshooting GPU instancing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/gpu-instancing-troubleshoot.html) | Solve common issues with GPU instancing, such as slower rendering.
