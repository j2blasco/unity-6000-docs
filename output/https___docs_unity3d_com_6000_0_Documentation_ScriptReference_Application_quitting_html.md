### Description
Unity raises this event when the Player application is quitting.
Add an event handler to this event to receive a notification that the application is quitting.  
  
**Notes** : The `Application.quitting` event is raised when the quitting process cannot be cancelled. Examples of when this event is not raised are: when the Player is forced to quit or if there is a crash. `Application.quitting` is invoked when exiting Play mode.  
  
**Android** : When an Android application is paused, the `Application.quitting` event doesn't get detected. This is because in the [paused state](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle#onpause), the `activity` is no longer visible. As an alternative approach, consider using [OnApplicationFocus(bool)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html) or [OnApplicationPause(bool)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationPause.html). `OnApplicationFocus(bool)` is called when the application loses or gains focus. `OnApplicationPause(bool)` is called when the application pauses on losing focus or resumes on regaining focus.   
  
**iOS** : iOS applications are usually suspended as they don't quit like applications on other platforms. Use `OnApplicationPause` to capture these events.  
  
**UWP** : On UWP apps, there's no application quit event; therefore, consider using `OnApplicationFocus` event when `focusStatus` equals false.  
  
To prevent the Player application from quitting, refer to the [Application.wantsToQuit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-wantsToQuit.html) event.
