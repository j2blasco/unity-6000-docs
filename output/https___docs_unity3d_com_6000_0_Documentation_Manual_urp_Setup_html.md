# Set up the 2D Renderer asset in URP
To use the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP) for 2D in your Unity project, create a project with a 2D URP asset and a 2D Universal Renderer asset.
## Requirements
  * Unity Editor version 2021.2.0b1 or higher.
  * URP package version 10 or higher.


## Create 2D URP rendering assets
  1. Open the Unity Hub.
  2. Select the **Univeral 2D** project, then **Create project**.
  3. When the new project opens, in the **Hierarchy** window, open the context menu (right-click) and select **Create** > **Rendering** > **URP Asset (with 2D Renderer)**.
  4. Enter a name for the new assets.


URP creates a new [URP Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/universalrp-asset.html), and assigns it a new [Universal Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/urp-universal-renderer.html) asset with `_Renderer` appended to the name. 
2D rendering is now set up for your project.
**Note** : Some of the settings in the URP asset that relate to 3D rendering wonâ€™t affect your final application.
