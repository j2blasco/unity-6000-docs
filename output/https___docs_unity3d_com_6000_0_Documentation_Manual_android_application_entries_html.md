The Activity application entry point
# Android application entry points
The application entry point fundamentally defines how Android runs your application. It defines things such as the type of game loop thread your application runs on and the implementation of lifecycle events, input events, and the onscreen keyboard. It’s important to understand the purpose, benefits, and limitations of each application entry point so you can select the most appropriate one for your application.
For more information on application entry points, refer to [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity), [GameActivity](https://developer.android.com/games/agdk/game-activity), and [Service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services).
