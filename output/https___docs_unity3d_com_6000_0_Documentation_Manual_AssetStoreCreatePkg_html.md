# Creating a new package draft
A package draft is a version of your package before you submit it to the **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore). At a minimum, a draft represents the information on the **Create new package** page, but it can also include the Assets from your Project.
To create a new draft:
  1. Open the [Asset Store Publisher](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/) portal and navigate to the **Packages** tab.
![The Packages tab displays any packages or package drafts on your Publisher Account](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/ASPG_CreateNewPackage.png) The Packages tab displays any packages or package drafts on your Publisher Account
  2. Click **Create New Package** to create a package draft.
The **Create new package** page appears.
  3. You can [fill out the package details](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStorePkgDetails.html) before or after you add your Assets to the package draft.


When you have a package draft, you can [add and upload your Assets](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreUpload.html) to it.
