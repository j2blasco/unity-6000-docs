### Description
Defines how an element is displayed in the layout. 
Unlike the visibility property, this property affects the layout of the element. This is a convenient way to hide an element without removing it from the hierarchy (when using the [DisplayStyle.None](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.DisplayStyle.None.html)).
