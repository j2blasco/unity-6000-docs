# Apply a cookie
To apply a cookie to a Light in Unity, assign a texture to the **Cookie** field of a [Light component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Light.html).
Cookies may support different features depending on the **render pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) you are using.
