shadowCascadeBlendCullingFactor; 
### Description
A multiplier applied to the radius of the culling sphere.  
  
Values must be in the range 0 to 1. With higher values, Unity culls more objects. Lower makes the cascades share more rendered objects. Using lower values allows blending between different cascades as they then share objects.
