### Description
Holds data for a single application crash event and provides access to all gathered crash reports.
If compiled with appropriate settings, Unity will try to gather useful information, like location and thread stack traces, when your application crashes. Upon the next application start, if the data gathering was successful, all crash information will be accessible using this API.  
  
To enable crash report generation, in iOS player settings set "Script Call Optimization" option to "Fast but no Exceptions". After you build your Xcode project in Unity, open it and edit trampoline file: Classes/CrashReporter.h. Change ENABLE_CUSTOM_CRASH_REPORTER define from 0 to 1. Note that the iOS Player Settings has a Crash Reporting setting with an "Enable CrashReport API".  
  
Note: this API currently is available only for iOS targets.
