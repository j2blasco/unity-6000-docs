### Description
Signifies that value of this property contains the main color of the Material.
This flag corresponds to the `[MainColor]` [ShaderLab Properties attribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SL-Properties.html).  
  
By default, Unity considers a color with the property name name `"_Color"` to be the main color. Use the `[MainColor]` ShaderLab Properties attribute to make Unity consider a color with a different property name to be the main color.
