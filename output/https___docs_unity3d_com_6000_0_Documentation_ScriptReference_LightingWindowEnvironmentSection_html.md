### Description
Base class for the Inspector that overrides the Environment section of the Lighting window.
See also [SupportedOnRenderPipelineAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.SupportedOnRenderPipelineAttribute.html).
```
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
  
[SupportedOnRenderPipeline(typeof(CustomSRPAsset))]
class CustomEnvironmentSection : LightingWindowEnvironmentSection[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightingWindowEnvironmentSection.html)
{
    public override void OnInspectorGUI()
    {
        // The following will be displayed instead of the Environment section in the LightingWindow
        EditorGUILayout.LabelField[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorGUILayout.LabelField.html)("My Custom Environment Section !!");
    }
}  
  

//Below is a custom empty render pipeline only here for explaining the filtering in ScriptableRenderPipelineExtension  
  
class CustomSRP : RenderPipeline[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipeline.html)
{
    protected override void Render(ScriptableRenderContext[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.html) context, Camera[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html)[] cameras)
    { /* My custom rendering algorithm */ }
}  
  
class CustomSRPAsset : RenderPipelineAsset[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipelineAsset.html)
{
    protected override RenderPipeline[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipeline.html) CreatePipeline()
    {
        return new CustomSRP();
    }
}

In this example, the Environment section of the Lighting window is overridden when the CustomSRP is in use.
