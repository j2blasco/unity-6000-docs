[JointLimits](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointLimits.html) limits; 
### Description
Limit of angular rotation (in degrees) on the hinge joint.
The joint will be limited so that the angle is always between [JointLimits.min](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointLimits-min.html) and [JointLimits.max](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointLimits-max.html). The joint angle is in degrees relative to the rest angle. The rest angle between the bodies is always zero at the beginning of the simulation.

        // Set the hinge limits for a door.
        HingeJoint[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html) hinge = GetComponent<HingeJoint[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html)>();  
  
        JointLimits[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointLimits.html) limits = hinge.limits;
        limits.min = 0;
        limits.bounciness = 0;
        limits.bounceMinVelocity = 0;
        limits.max = 90;
        hinge.limits = limits;
        hinge.useLimits = true;
    }
}

Modifying the limits does **not** automatically enable the limits.
