linearDamping; 
### Description
The linear damping of the Rigidbody linear velocity.
linearDamping can be used to slow down an object. Zero indicates that no damping should be used whereas higher values increase the damping, effectively slowing down the linear motion faster. **Note:** The following formula is how the linear damping is applied: `linearVelocity *= ( 1 - linearDamping * dt )` Additional resources: [Rigidbody.angularDamping](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-angularDamping.html). 
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) rb;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)>();
    }

    {
        rb.linearDamping = 20;
