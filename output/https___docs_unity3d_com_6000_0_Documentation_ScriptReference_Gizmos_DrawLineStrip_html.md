## Declaration
public static void DrawLineStrip(ReadOnlySpan<Vector3> points, bool looped); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
points | The points that define the sequence of lines to draw. The function draws a line between each point and the one that follows it.  
looped | Whether to draw an additional line between the last point and the first. When this is `true`, Unity draws an additional line between `points[points.Length - 1]` and `points[0]`. When this is `false`, the lines terminate at the last point.  
### Description
Draws a line between each point in the supplied span.
This function provides a more efficient way to draw multiple lines than repeatedly calling the [Gizmos.DrawLine](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.DrawLine.html) function for each one.  
  
Unity draws the first line from `points[0]` to `points[1]`, the next from `points[1]` to `points[2]`, and so on.
