reportAbsoluteDpadValues; 
### Description
Configures how touches are mapped to analog joystick axes in relative or absolute values. 
When set to true, touching the far right of the remote touch area will return +1 on the horizontal axis and touching the far left will return -1. The same applies for touches on the vertical axis. When this property is set to false, the user needs to swipe instead of touching specific areas of the remote to generate horizontal or vertical input. The default setting is false.
