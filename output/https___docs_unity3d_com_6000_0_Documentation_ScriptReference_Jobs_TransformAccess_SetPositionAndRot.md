## Declaration
public void SetPositionAndRotation([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) position, [Quaternion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) rotation); 
### Description
Sets the world space position and rotation of the transform.
When setting both the position and rotation of a transform, calling this method is more efficient than assigning to position and rotation individually.
