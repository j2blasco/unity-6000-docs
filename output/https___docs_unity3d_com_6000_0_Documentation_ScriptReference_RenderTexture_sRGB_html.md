sRGB; 
### Description
Does this render texture use sRGB read/write conversions? (Read Only).
When [Linear color space](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LinearLighting.html) is used, render textures can perform Linear to sRGB conversions when rendering into them and sRGB to Linear conversions when sampling them in the shaders.  
  
The value of this property is based on the "readWrite" parameter of the [RenderTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html) constructor.  
  
Additional resources: [RenderTextureReadWrite](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureReadWrite.html) for more details.
