## Declaration
public static void DrawLineList(ReadOnlySpan<Vector3> points); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
points | Pairs of points to use as the beginning and end of each line to draw. Unity throws an exception if `points` contains an odd number of elements.  
### Description
Draws multiple lines between pairs of points.
This function provides a more efficient way to draw multiple lines than repeatedly calling the [Gizmos.DrawLine](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.DrawLine.html) function for each one.  
  
Each pair of points from the `points` span represents the start and end of each line, so Unity draws the first line from `points[0]` to `points[1]`, the next from `points[2]` to `points[3]`, and so on.
