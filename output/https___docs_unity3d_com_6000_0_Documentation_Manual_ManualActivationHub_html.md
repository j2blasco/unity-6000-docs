# Submit a license request from the Hub
Submit a license request from the Unity Hub to manually activate your license if you’re unable to use the [other activation methods](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LicenseActivationMethods.html).
**Note** : The manual activation method works only with plans other than Unity Personal. To activate a license for Unity Personal, log in to the Unity Hub. To return a Personal license, log out of the Unity Hub.
Although you can submit a license request from the computer where you plan to use Unity, the following procedure shows a workaround if that computer can’t connect to the internet. The following procedure assumes you have access to two computers, as follows:
  * The first computer is the computer where you installed Unity, but the computer can’t connect to the internet.
  * The second computer is any computer that can connect to the internet.


## Procedure
  1. On the first computer, open the Unity Hub. 
  2. Open the Preferences menu: ![Cog](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/hubPref.png)
  3. Select **Licenses** from the side menu.
  4. Select **Add**.
  5. Select **Activate with license request**.
  6. Follow the **Download license request** step on-screen. This step creates an `.alf` file on the first computer. Don’t close the Unity Hub, since you’ll be returning to it in a later step.
  7. Copy the `.alf` file from the previous step to a second computer that has internet access.
  8. Use the second computer to go to [license.unity3d.com/manual](https://license.unity3d.com/manual) and follow the instructions there. This step generates a `.ulf` file. If you experience issues accessing the website:
     * Go to [id.unity.com](https://id.unity.com/) and make sure you’re signed in to your Unity ID. You need a valid login to request a Unity license file.
     * Try pasting `https://license.unity3d.com/manual` into your browser’s address bar.
  9. Copy the `.ulf` license file from the second computer to the first computer.
  10. From the first computer, follow Unity Hub’s **Activate with license file** on-screen. This step doesn’t need internet access.


After completing the process, you can view your active license in the Hub by opening the Preferences menu (![](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/hubPref.png)) and selecting **Licenses**.
