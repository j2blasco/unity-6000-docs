Unity multiplayer overview
# Multiplayer
A multiplayer project can host many users in the same project, either locally or through a networked server. To build a multiplayer game, use a combination of Unity’s multiplayer packages and services. Refer to the [Unity multiplayer overview](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/multiplayer-overview.html) for more information or refer to the [additional resources on this page](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/multiplayer.html#additional-resources).
If you’re just getting started with multiplayer games, the recommended entry point is the [Multiplayer Center package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/multiplayer-center.html), which suggests Unity multiplayer packages based on the needs of your game, and gives you access to samples and tutorials to help you use them.
