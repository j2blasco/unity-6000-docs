### Description
Interface that represents a job that performs the same independent operation for each element of a native container or for a fixed number of iterations.
When you schedule an `IJobParallelFor` job, its `Execute(int index)` method is invoked on multiple worker threads in parallel to each other.  
  
`Execute(int index)` is executed once for each index from 0 to the provided length. Each iteration must be independent from other iterations and the safety system enforces this rule for you. The indices have no guaranteed order and are executed on multiple cores in parallel.  
  
Unity automatically splits the work into chunks no less than the provided `batchSize`, and schedules an appropriate number of jobs based on the number of worker threads, the length of the array, and the batch size. Choose the batch size depending on the amount of work performed in the job. A simple job, for example adding a couple of Vector3 to each other should have a batch size of 32 to 128. However if the work performed is very expensive then it's best practice to use a small batch size, for example a batch size of 1. IJobParallelFor uses atomic operations to perform work stealing. Batch sizes can be small but they are not for free.  
  
You can use the returned `JobHandle` to make sure that the job has completed, or you can pass it to other jobs as a dependency to make sure that the jobs are executed one after another on the worker threads.
