maxNumberOfQueries; 
### Description
The maximum number of queries that the [PhysicsDebugWindow](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsDebugWindow.html) will visualize at one given time.
[PhysicsDebugWindow](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsDebugWindow.html) takes the [PhysicsVisualizationSettings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsVisualizationSettings.html) filtering settings into account before appending a query to the visualization list and therefore will prevent filtered out queries from increasing the total number of queries.
