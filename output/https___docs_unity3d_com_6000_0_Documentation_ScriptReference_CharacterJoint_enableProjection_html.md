enableProjection; 
### Description
Brings violated constraints back into alignment even when the solver fails.
Projection is not a physical process and does not preserve momentum or respect collision geometry. It is best avoided if practical, but can be useful in improving simulation quality where joint separation results in unacceptable artifacts.
