[ActionOnDotNetUnhandledException](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ActionOnDotNetUnhandledException.html) actionOnDotNetUnhandledException; 
### Description
Sets the crash behavior on .NET unhandled exception.
The options are `ActionOnDotNetUnhandledException.Crash` (the application crashes hardly and forces iOS to generate a crash report that can be submitted to iTunes by app users and inspected by developers) and `ActionOnDotNetUnhandledException.Silent Exit` (the application exits gracefully).
