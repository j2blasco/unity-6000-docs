## Declaration
public void SetMasterAtlas([U2D.SpriteAtlas](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/U2D.SpriteAtlas.html) atlas); 
### Description
Sets an Atlas to be the Master Atlas.
This method sets a valid Master Atlas to this Atlas but does not automatically turn it into a Variant Sprite Atlas. Use [SpriteAtlasExtensions.SetIsVariant](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/U2D.SpriteAtlasExtensions.SetIsVariant.html) to turn this Atlas into a Variant.
