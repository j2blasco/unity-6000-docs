## Declaration
public bool Simulate(float deltaTime, int simulationLayers = Physics2D.AllLayers); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
deltaTime | The time to advance physics by.  
simulationLayers | The [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) and [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) layers to simulate.  
### Returns
**bool** Whether the simulation was run or not. Running the simulation during physics callbacks will always fail. 
### Description
Simulate physics associated with this [PhysicsScene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene.html).
Calling [PhysicsScene2D.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene2D.Simulate.html) will perform a single simulation step, simulating physics over the specified `step` time.  
  
By default, [All Layers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics2D.AllLayers.html) are simulated, however if you specify layers then only the [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) will be simulated. Along with this, only contacts for [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) on the specified layer(s) will be handled. Finally, only [joints](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.html) or [effectors](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Effector2D.html) on the specified layer(s) will be handled.  
  
You can call [PhysicsScene2D.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene2D.Simulate.html) in the Editor outside of play mode, however caution is advised as this will cause the simulation to move GameObjects that have an attached [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) component. When simulating in the Editor outside of play mode, a full simulation occurs for all physics components including [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html), [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html), [Joint2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.html) and [Effector2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Effector2D.html), and contacts are generated. However, contacts are not reported via the standard script callbacks. This is a safety measure to prevent callbacks from deleting objects in the Scene, which is not an undoable operation.  
  
**NOTE:** Calling [Physics2D.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics2D.Simulate.html) does not cause Unity to call FixedUpdate. Unity still calls [MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html) at the rate defined by [Time.fixedDeltaTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-fixedDeltaTime.html) whether automatic simulation is on or off, and regardless of when you call Physics2D.Simulate. Also, if you pass framerate-dependent step values (such as [Time.deltaTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html)) to the physics engine, your simulation will be less deterministic because of the unpredictable fluctuations in framerate that can arise. To achieve more deterministic physics results, you should pass a fixed step value to Physics2D.Simulate every time you call it.

Here is an example of a basic simulation that implements what's being done in the automatic simulation mode.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class BasicSimulation : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public PhysicsScene[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene.html) physicsScene;
    private float timer;  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        if (!physicsScene.IsValid())
            return; // do nothing if the physics Scene[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.Scene.html) is not valid.  
  
        timer += Time.deltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html);  
  
        // Catch up with the game time.
        // Advance the physics simulation in portions of Time.fixedDeltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-fixedDeltaTime.html)
        // Note that generally, we don't want to pass variable delta to Simulate as that leads to unstable results.
        while (timer >= Time.fixedDeltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-fixedDeltaTime.html))
        {
            timer -= Time.fixedDeltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-fixedDeltaTime.html);
            physicsScene.Simulate(Time.fixedDeltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-fixedDeltaTime.html));
        }  
  
        // Here you can access the transforms state right after the simulation, if needed...
    }
}

```
