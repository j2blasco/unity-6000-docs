Create a panel
# Configure runtime UI
To render UI and react to input from the users in the Game view, create a Panel Settings asset and a UI Document component. The Panel Settings asset defines a panel in the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) where the UI is rendered. The UI Document component connects the UI to the panel.
