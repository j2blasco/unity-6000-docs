[SpriteMaskInteraction](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpriteMaskInteraction.html) maskInteraction; 
### Description
Specifies how the [Tilemap](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Tilemaps.Tilemap.html) interacts with the masks.
Tilemaps by default do not interact with Sprite Masks, and remain at their original visibility even when overlapping masks. Set this value to either VisibleInsideMask or VisibleOutsideMask to have the Tilemap interact with Sprite Masks. Set this value to VisibleInsideMask to have the Tilemap visible within a mask, and set to VisibleOutsideMask to achieve the inverse effect.
