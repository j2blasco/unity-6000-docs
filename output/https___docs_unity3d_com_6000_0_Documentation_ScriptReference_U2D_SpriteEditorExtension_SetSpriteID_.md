## Declaration
public static void SetSpriteID([Sprite](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Sprite.html) sprite, GUID guid); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
sprite | The Sprite to set.  
guid | The GUID to set for the Sprite.  
### Description
Sets a [Sprite](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Sprite.html)'s Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for easy identification later.
During Sprite Asset generation, you can manually set a [Sprite's](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Sprite.html) SpriteID to identify the [Sprite](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Sprite.html) from the data that was used to generate it.  
  
This is usually needed when [Sprites](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Sprite.html) are generated by [ScriptedImporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetImporters.ScriptedImporter.html) via [Sprite.Create](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Sprite.Create.html) and the [ScriptedImporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetImporters.ScriptedImporter.html) wants to support SpriteEditorModuleBase that uses [AssetPostprocessor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.html) to modify during [Sprite](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Sprite.html) generation.
