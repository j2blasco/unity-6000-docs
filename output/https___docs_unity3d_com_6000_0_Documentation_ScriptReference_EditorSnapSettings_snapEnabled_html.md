### Description
Gets or sets whether snapping is enabled.
Enable to quantize built-in Scene view Transform tools, such as Move, Rotate, Scale, Transform, and Rect, to rounded values when they are manipulated.   
  
The translate handle snaps to the nearest point on the [SceneView](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneView.html) grid when the Tool Handle Rotation is set to **Global**. In all other cases, the Increment Snapping values are applied.
