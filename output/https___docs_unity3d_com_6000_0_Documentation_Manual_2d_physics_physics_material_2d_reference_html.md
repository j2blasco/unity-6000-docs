# Physics Material 2D reference
A ****Physics Material** A physics asset for adjusting the friction and bouncing effects of colliding objects. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-PhysicsMaterial.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#PhysicsMaterial) 2D** is used to adjust the friction and bounce that occur between 2D physics objects when they collide.
For more detailed information on game physics, see [3D Physics](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PhysicsSection.html).
## Use a Physics Material 2D
To create a Physics Material 2D, go to **Assets > Create > 2D > Physics Material 2D**.
**Property** | **Function**  
---|---  
**Friction** | Set the coefficient of friction for this **collider** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collider).  
**Bounciness** | Set the degree to which **collisions** A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collision) rebound from the surface. A value of 0 indicates no bounce while a value of 1 indicates a perfect bounce with no loss of energy.  
To use your created **Physics Material 2D** Use to adjust the friction and bounce that occurs between 2D physics objects when they collide [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/physics-material-2d-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#PhysicsMaterial2D), drag it onto an object with an attached 2D Collider component or drag it onto the collider in the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector) window.
**Note:** The equivalent asset in 3D physics is referred to as a **Physics Material**.
