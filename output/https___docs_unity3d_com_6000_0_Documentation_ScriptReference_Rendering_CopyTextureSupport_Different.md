### Description
Support for [Graphics.CopyTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.CopyTexture.html) between different texture types.
When this flag is set, [Graphics.CopyTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.CopyTexture.html) can do copies between different texture "dimensions", for example copy a single cubemap face into a regular 2D texture; or copy from a 2D texture into a slice of 2D Array texture. See Graphics.CopyTextureSupport for an overview.
