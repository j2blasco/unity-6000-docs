### Description
Informs about significant changes in the application's memory usage.
This event occurs when there are significant changes in the application's memory usage, such as an increase to a dangerous level or a drop to a much safer level.  
  
You can use this event to balance your application's memory usage for device capability. For example, you can lower the resource intensity of your application when memory usage becomes critical.  
  
iOS, Android, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) support this event, but not every platform supports all possible [ApplicationMemoryUsage](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ApplicationMemoryUsage.html) values. 
  * Android supports [Medium](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ApplicationMemoryUsage.Medium.html), [High](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ApplicationMemoryUsage.High.html), and [Critical](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ApplicationMemoryUsage.Critical.html).   
**Note:** When targeting [GameActivity](https://developer.android.com/games/agdk/game-activity), only [Critical](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ApplicationMemoryUsage.Critical.html) is supported.
  * iOS supports [Critical](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ApplicationMemoryUsage.Critical.html).
  * UWP supports [Low](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ApplicationMemoryUsage.Low.html), [Medium](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ApplicationMemoryUsage.Medium.html), [High](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ApplicationMemoryUsage.High.html), and [Critical](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ApplicationMemoryUsage.Critical.html).

This code sample shows how to perform garbage collection if the application is critically low on memory.
