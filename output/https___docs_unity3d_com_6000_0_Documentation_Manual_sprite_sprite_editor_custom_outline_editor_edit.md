# Edit the custom outline
You can create your own custom shape and edit it in two ways. The first way is by automatically [generating](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-editor/custom-outline-editor/generate-outline.html) an outline, and then moving the control points of the generated outline to further refine its shape. Alternatively click and drag over any space in the Custom Outline editor window to create a rectangular outline with four control points and begin refining the outline by moving the control points or adding and removing them.
![You can create multiple outlines in the same texture.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/2DCustomOutline_2.png) You can create multiple outlines in the same texture.
Click and drag over the **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) texture in the editor window to create rectangle outlines with four control points. Repeat this step to create multiple **Mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Mesh) outlines within the Sprite. Unity only renders the areas enclosed within the Mesh outlines.
