public static bool CopyAssets(string[] paths, string[] newPaths); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---

newPaths | Filesystem paths of the new assets to create.  
### Returns
**bool** Returns true if the copy operation is successful or false if part of the process fails.

You cannot use this function during an import (either in process or from an asset worker), as it would result in new assets created in the middle of an import. Any errors and warnings from the copy operation are reported in the log and the console.
