flipGreenChannel; 
### Description
Indicates whether to invert the green channel values of a normal map.
Inverting the green (Y) channel values of a normal map is useful if the normal map uses a different convention to what Unity expects.  
  
If the normal map conventions require more general channel swizzles or inversions, use the [swizzleR](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporter-swizzleR.html), [swizzleG](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporter-swizzleG.html), [swizzleB](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporter-swizzleB.html), [swizzleA](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporter-swizzleA.html) settings.
