Code examples: Call JavaScript and C/C++/C# functions in Unity
# Interaction with browser scripting
When you build content for the web, you might need to communicate with other elements on your web page or use Web APIs to implement functionality that Unity doesn’t expose by default. 
In both cases, you need to directly interface with the browser’s JavaScript engine. Unity Web provides different methods to handle these interactions.
Topic | Description  
---|---  
[Code examples: Call JavaScript and C/C++/C# functions in Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/web-interacting-code-example.html) | Code examples that show interactions between Unity, JavaScript, and C-based code.  
[Set up your JavaScript plug-in](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/web-interacting-browser-js.html) | Create a JavaScript **plug-in** A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Plug-in) that your Unity project can interact with.
