# Using labels to organize My Assets
Labels help you organize your list of packages in the **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore) and in the Package Manager window. Labels are like user-defined categories, or collections that help you find packages easily.
You can only create and use labels on the Asset Store website.
![Your list of downloaded or purchased packages from the Asset Store appear on the My Assets page](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetPackage-labels.png) Your list of downloaded or purchased packages from the Asset Store appear on the **My Assets** page
**(A)** Click **Manage my labels** to go to edit mode, where you can assign labels to more than one package at a time.
**(B)** Labels you have already assigned to this package. If you haven’t assigned any labels to the package yet, **Add label** appears instead.
**(C)** Click **Edit label** to display the **Edit Labels** window where you can create and assign labels for this package.
**(D)** Click **Add label** to display a window where you can create and assign labels for this package. If you have already assigned a label to the package, the label(s) appear instead.
**(E)** Your list of labels appears here. When you select a label from this list, only those packages that have that label assigned appear in the list. You can select multiple labels at once.
## Creating labels
The **Edit Labels** window lets you create and apply labels at the same time.
To create a new label:
  1. Go to the Unity Asset Store and sign into your Unity account.
  2. Go to the [My Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/account/assets) page and click the **Add label** link.
The **Edit Labels** window appears.
![Create, add, and remove labels for your selected package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetPackage-editlabel.png) Create, add, and remove labels for your selected package
  3. Enter the name for your new label in the text box.
  4. Click **Save** to save and apply the label to the selected package or **Cancel** if you don’t want to create the label at all.
The Edit Labels window closes and you can view the **My Assets** list again.


## Adding and removing labels
On the **My Assets** page, if a package already has a label, the **Edit label** link appears under the release note for that package. If it doesn’t have a label, the **Add label** link appears. Either of these links open the **Edit Labels** window, where you can add or remove labels.
![The links to the Edit Labels window change depending on whether the package already has labels](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetPackage-addlabel.png) The links to the Edit Labels window change depending on whether the package already has labels
To add (apply) an existing label to a package:
  1. Click either **Add label** or **Edit label** to open the **Edit Labels** window.
  2. To select a label and add it to the selected package, on the **Edit Labels** window, click in the text box. A drop-down shows any labels not yet assigned to this package. Click on the label you want to apply. The label now appears under the text box.
  3. Click the **x** on the label underneath the text box to remove any label.
  4. When you’re finished adding and removing labels for the selected package, click the **Save** button, or click **Cancel** if you don’t want to make any changes.


## Adding labels to more than one package at once
  1. Click **Manage my labels** to display checkboxes next to each package in the list. A set of group links also appear at the top.
![In edit mode, checkboxes appear beside each package and links that apply to all selected packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetPackage-masslabel.png) In edit mode, checkboxes appear beside each package and links that apply to all selected packages
  2. Enable **Select all** to select all packages at once or click the checkbox beside each package you want to include.
  3. Click **Edit label** at the top of the page to open the **Edit Labels** window.
  4. Click inside the text box to choose a label from the list to add that label to the selected package(s).
  5. Click the **x** on any label underneath the text box to remove that label from the selection package(s).
  6. When you’re finished adding and removing labels for the selected packages, click the **Save** button, or click **Cancel** if you don’t want to make any changes.
  7. To exit the edit mode, click **Done**.


## Deleting labels
Labels only exist when they are in use, so to delete a label from the list of labels, remove that label from all assets that use it:
  1. In the Unity Asset Store, go to the **My Assets** page.
  2. Click **Manage my labels** to display checkboxes next to each package in the list. A set of group links also appear at the top.
  3. Select every package that has the label you want to delete.
  4. Click **Edit label** at the top of the list of packages.
The **Edit Labels** window appears.
  5. Click the **x** on the label underneath the text box to remove them.
  6. Click the **Save** button to close the **Edit Labels** window and return to the **My Assets** list (still in edit mode).
  7. Click Done to exit the edit mode.
The label you deleted no longer appears in the **Labels** section of the filter sidebar.
