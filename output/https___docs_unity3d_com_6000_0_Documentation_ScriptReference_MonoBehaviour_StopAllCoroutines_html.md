## Declaration
public void StopAllCoroutines(); 
### Description
Stops all coroutines running on this behaviour.
A MonoBehaviour can execute zero or more coroutines. Created coroutines can execute for a range of times. In the script example below two coroutines are created and run without stopping. However, [StopAllCoroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.StopAllCoroutines.html) is used to stop both of them. This action can be made to happen on a script that runs multiple coroutines. No arguments are needed because all coroutines on a script are stopped.  
**Note:** [StopAllCoroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.StopAllCoroutines.html) operates only on the one script it is attached to. 
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
// Create two coroutines that run at different speeds.
// When the space key is pressed stop both of them.  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    //coroutine 1
    IEnumerator DoSomething1()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            print("DoSomething1");
            yield return new WaitForSeconds[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WaitForSeconds.html)(1.0f);
        }
    }  
  
    //coroutine 2
    IEnumerator DoSomething2()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            print("DoSomething2");
            yield return new WaitForSeconds[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WaitForSeconds.html)(1.5f);
        }
    }  
  
    void Start()
    {
        StartCoroutine("DoSomething1");
        StartCoroutine("DoSomething2");
    }  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetKeyDown.html)("space"))
        {
            StopAllCoroutines();
            print("Stopped all Coroutines: " + Time.time[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-time.html));
        }
    }
}
