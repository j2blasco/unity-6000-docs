### Description
Subscribe to this event to be able to customize the collision response of CCD generated contact pairs.
Similar to [Physics.ContactModifyEvent](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.ContactModifyEvent.html) but dedicated to contact pairs that have been generated by the CCD solver. Each subscriber to this event gets invoked with a physics scene, a native array of contact pairs to process. Each contact pair has modifiable data, like impulses and contact normals that can be changed in order to customize the bounce behavior.  
  
Note: the contact normal in this callback is always inverted. After the callback, physics system inverts it again.
