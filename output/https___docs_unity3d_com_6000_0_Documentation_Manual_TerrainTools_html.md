# Terrain Tools package
The [Terrain Tools package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.terrain-tools@latest) provides additional functionality on top of Unity’s [built-in Terrain tools](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/terrain-Tools.html). It includes more advanced features such as erosion tools, sculpting tools, and brush mask filters. It also contains the **Terrain** The landscape in your scene. A Terrain GameObject adds a large flat plane to your scene and you can use the Terrain’s Inspector window to create a detailed landscape. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/terrain-UsingTerrains.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Terrain) Toolbox, which lets you create new terrain from preset files or imported **heightmaps** A greyscale Texture that stores height data for an object. Each pixel stores the height difference perpendicular to the face that pixel represents.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Heightmap), batch change settings on multiple terrain tiles, and import/export splatmaps and heightmaps.
This add-on toolset is suitable if you require more control over the appearance of your Terrain, and wish to streamline Terrain workflows. It’s also useful when you want to make more complex-looking Terrain, or author Terrain Texture data in external tools such as Houdini and World Machine.
For more information about how to install and use the Terrain Tools package, see the [Terrain Tools package documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.terrain-tools@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/getting-started-with-terrain-tools.html).
