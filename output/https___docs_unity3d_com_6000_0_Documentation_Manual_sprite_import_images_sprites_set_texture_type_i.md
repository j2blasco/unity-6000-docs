# Set the Texture Type of an imported image to Sprite (2D and UI)
To change an assetâ€™s **Texture Type** :
  1. Select the asset to access its **Import**Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector)**.
  2. Set the **Texture Type** to ****Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) (2D and UI)**.


For more information about the sprite **Texture Type** settings, refer to the [Sprite (2D and UI) import settings reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/texture-type-sprite.html).
