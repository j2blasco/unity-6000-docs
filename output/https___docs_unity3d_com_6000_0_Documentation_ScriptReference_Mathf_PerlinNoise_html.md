## Declaration
public static float PerlinNoise(float x, float y); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
x | X-coordinate of sample point.  
y | Y-coordinate of sample point.  
### Returns
**float** Value between 0.0 and 1.0. (Return value might be slightly below 0.0 or beyond 1.0.) 
### Description
Generate 2D Perlin noise.
Perlin noise is a pseudo-random pattern of float values generated across a 2D plane (although the technique does generalise to three or more dimensions, this is not implemented in Unity). The noise does not contain a completely random value at each point but rather consists of "waves" whose values gradually increase and decrease across the pattern. The noise can be used as the basis for texture effects but also for animation, generating terrain heightmaps and many other things.  
  
![](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/StaticFiles/ScriptRefImages/PerlinExample.png)  
_Perlin noise sampled in the range 0..10 (the greyscale values represent values from 0..1)_  
  
Any point in the plane can be sampled by passing the appropriate X and Y coordinates. The same coordinates will always return the same sample value but the plane is essentially infinite so it is easy to avoid repetition by choosing a random area to sample from.

**Note:** The return value can be slightly lower than 0.0f or slightly higher than 1.0f. If you need the range of return values to be between 0.0 and 1.0, clamp the return values.
