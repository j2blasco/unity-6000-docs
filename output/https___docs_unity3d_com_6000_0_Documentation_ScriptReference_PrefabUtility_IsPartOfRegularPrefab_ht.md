## Declaration
public static bool IsPartOfRegularPrefab([Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Object.html) componentOrGameObject); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
componentOrGameObject | The object to check. Must be a component or GameObject.  
### Returns
**bool** True if the object is part of a regular Prefab. 
### Description
Returns true if the given object is part of a regular Prefab instance or Prefab Asset.
Returns false is the object is part of a Model Prefab or Prefab Variant.  
  
An object is part of a regular Prefab instance if it has a regular Prefab as its outermost Prefab instance root. To get the outermost Prefab instance root, use [GetOutermostPrefabInstanceRoot](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PrefabUtility.GetOutermostPrefabInstanceRoot.html).  
  
For Prefab contents loaded in Prefab Mode, this method will not check the Prefab Asset the loaded contents are loaded from, since these Prefab contents are loaded into a preview scene and are not part of an asset while being edited in Prefab Mode. This means that for Prefab contents in Prefab Mode, the method will only return true for objects that are part of a regular Prefab instance. To check if an object is part of the Prefabâ€™s contents in Prefab Mode, use [PrefabStage.IsPartOfPrefabContents](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.PrefabStage.IsPartOfPrefabContents.html).
