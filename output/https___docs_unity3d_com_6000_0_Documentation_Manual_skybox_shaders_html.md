# Configure a skybox with a Skybox Shader
Unity provides multiple **Skybox** A special type of Material used to represent skies. Usually six-sided. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sky-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Skybox) Shaders for you to use. Each **Shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) uses a different set of properties and generation techniques. Each Shader falls into one of the following two categories:
**Note:** The [High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/high-definition-render-pipeline.html) does not support any of the above Shaders and instead includes multiple sky generation solutions.
## Textured
Generates a skybox from one or multiple textures. The source textures represent the view of the background from all directions. The Skybox Shaders in this category are:
  * 6 Sided
  * Cubemap
  * Panoramic


### 6 Sided Skybox shader
This skybox Shader generates a skybox from six separate Textures. Each texture represents a view of the sky along a particular world axis. To illustrate this, think of the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) as being inside a cube. Each Texture represents one of the interior faces of the cube and all six combine to create a seamless environment.
To create a **6 Sided** skybox, you need six individual Textures that, when combined, map to a net layout like:
![Skybox cube texture.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/skybox-six-sided-net.png) Skybox cube texture.
To generate the best ambient lighting, the Textures should use a [high dynamic range (HDR)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/hdr-landing.html).
### Cubemap Skybox shader
This skybox Shader generates a skybox from a single [Cubemap Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Cubemap-landing.html). This **Cubemap** A collection of six square textures that can represent the reflections in an environment or the skybox drawn behind your geometry. The six squares form the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object; each face represents the view along the directions of the world axes (up, down, left, right, forward and back). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Cubemap-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Cubemap) consists of six square Textures and represents the entire view of the sky from every direction.
### Panoramic Skybox shader
To generate a skybox, the Panoramic Shader wraps a single Texture spherically around the Scene.
For information on how to create a Material that uses this skybox Shader, as well as details on how to render the skybox in your Scene, see [Using skyboxes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/skyboxes-using.html).
To create a **Panoramic** skybox, you need a single 2D Texture that uses latitude-longitude (cylindrical) mapping, like so:
![Texture with latitude-longitude \(cylindrical\) mapping.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/skybox-lat-long-layout.png) Texture with latitude-longitude (cylindrical) mapping.
To make sure the Texture is 2D:
  1. In the **Project window** A window that shows the contents of your `Assets` folder (Project tab) [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ProjectView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Projectwindow), select the Texture.
  2. In the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector), make sure the **Texture Shape** is set to **2D**.


To generate the best ambient lighting, the Texture should use a [high dynamic range (HDR)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/hdr-landing.html).
## Procedural Skybox shader
The Procedural skybox Shader does not require any input Textures and instead generates a skybox purely from the properties set in the Material Inspector.
### Positioning the sun
If you choose to render a sun disk in your skybox (see **Sun** in [Properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-skybox-procedural.html)), this Shader uses the rotation of the active [Light](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Light.html) to position the sun in the skybox. To find the active Light:
  1. Open the Lighting window (menu: **Window > Rendering > Lighting**).
  2. Navigate to the **Environment** tab.
  3. The Light assigned to **Sun Source** is your Sceneâ€™s active Light.
  4. If there is no Light assigned to **Sun Source** , assign the Light in your Scene you want to become the active Light to **Sun Source**.


You can use this behaviour to create a simple day-night cycle. To do this, continuously rotate your main Directional Light around a particular axis.
