### Description
Returns `true` after the [UnityWebRequest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) has finished communicating with the remote server. (Read Only)
This property will return `true` both when the [UnityWebRequest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) finishes successfully, or when it encounters a system error. All post-download processing by the [DownloadHandler](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.DownloadHandler.html) (if any) will be completed before this property returns `true`.
