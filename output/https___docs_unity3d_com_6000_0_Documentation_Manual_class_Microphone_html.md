# Microphone
[Switch to Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Microphone.html "Go to Microphone page in the Scripting Reference")
The **Microphone** class is useful for capturing input from a built-in or physical microphone on your PC or mobile device.
With this class, you can start and end a recording from a built-in microphone, get a listing of available audio input devices (microphones), and find out the status of each such input device. 
There is no component for the Microphone class but you can access it from a script. Refer to the [Microphone](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Microphone.html) page in the Scripting Reference for further information.
