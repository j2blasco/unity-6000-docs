### Description
Space key.
Keyboard code for the Space key, used in [Input.GetKeyDown](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetKeyDown.html) and [Input.GetKeyUp](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetKeyUp.html). It can also be used as a string for [Event.KeyboardEvent](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Event.KeyboardEvent.html) by adding `.ToString()`.  
  
Examples for both usage types can be found on the [KeyCode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html) page.
