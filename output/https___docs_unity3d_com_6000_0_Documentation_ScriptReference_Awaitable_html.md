### Description
Custom Unity type that can be awaited and used as an async return type in the C# asynchronous programming model.
`Awaitable` is usually a preferable alternative to .NET `Task` for asynchronous code in Unity. It's important, however, to know the differences between the two. Most notably, instances of the `Awaitable` class are pooled and therefore not safe to `await` multiple times in the same method.  
  
For more information, refer to [Asynchronous programming with the Awaitable class](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/async-await-support.html) in the Manual.
```
private async Awaitable[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.html) DoSomethingAsync()
{
   await LoadSceneAsync("SomeScene");
   await SomeApiReturningATask();
   await Awaitable.NextFrameAsync[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.NextFrameAsync.html)();
   // <...>
}

### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[IsCompleted](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.IsCompleted.html) | Indicates if the awaitable has run to completion.  
### Public Methods
Method | Description  
---|---  
[Cancel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.Cancel.html) | Cancels the awaitable. If the awaitable is being awaited, the awaiter receives a System.OperationCanceledException.  
### Static Methods
Method | Description  
---|---  
[BackgroundThreadAsync](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.BackgroundThreadAsync.html) | Resumes execution on a ThreadPool background thread. Completes immediately when called from a background thread.  
[EndOfFrameAsync](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.EndOfFrameAsync.html) | Resumes execution after all Unity subsystems have run for the current frame.  
[FixedUpdateAsync](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.FixedUpdateAsync.html) | Resumes execution on the next fixed update frame.  
[FromAsyncOperation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.FromAsyncOperation.html) | Creates an Awaitable from an existing AsyncOperation object.  
[MainThreadAsync](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.MainThreadAsync.html) | Resumes execution on the Unity main thread. Completes immediately when called from the main thread.  
[NextFrameAsync](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.NextFrameAsync.html) | Resumes execution on the next frame.  
[WaitForSecondsAsync](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.WaitForSecondsAsync.html) | Resumes execution after the specified number of seconds.
