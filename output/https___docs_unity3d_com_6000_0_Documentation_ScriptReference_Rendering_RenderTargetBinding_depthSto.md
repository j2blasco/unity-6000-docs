[Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction.html) depthStoreAction; 
### Description
Store action for the depth/stencil buffer.
Not all platforms support store actions. If the platform you are using does not support store actions, [RenderBufferStoreAction.Store](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction.Store.html) will be used instead.
