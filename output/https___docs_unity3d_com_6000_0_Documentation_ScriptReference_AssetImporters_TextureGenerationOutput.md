[Texture2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D.html) texture; 
### Description
This is a [Texture2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D.html) generated by [TextureGenerator.GenerateTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetImporters.TextureGenerator.GenerateTexture.html) based on the colorBuffer argument passed to that function. If the generator is configured to generate a non-2D texture (cubemap, 3D, ...), this member will always be null. To get the result for an arbitrary texture type, please use the [TextureGenerationOutput.output](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetImporters.TextureGenerationOutput-output.html) property. We recommend always using [TextureGenerationOutput.output](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetImporters.TextureGenerationOutput-output.html) as the texture property will deprecated/removed in the future.
