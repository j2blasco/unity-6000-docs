### Description
Support for [Texture3D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture3D.html) in [Graphics.CopyTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.CopyTexture.html).
Not all platforms can do 3D texture copies, e.g. currently Direct3D9 systems can not do that. See [CopyTextureSupport](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CopyTextureSupport.html) for an overview.
