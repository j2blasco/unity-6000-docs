## Declaration
public void AddForce([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) force, [ForceMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.html) mode = ForceMode.Force); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
force | The force vector to apply.  
mode | The type of force to apply.  
### Description
Applies a force to the [ArticulationBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html).
Note that the force accumulates over the duration of a simulation frame. It is only physically applied to the articulation body during the simulation step, after [FixedUpdate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html) has been called to scripts. Specifying the [ForceMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.html) `mode` allows the type of force to be changed to an Acceleration, Impulse or Velocity Change.  
  
You can only apply a force to an active ArticulationBody. If a GameObject is inactive, AddForce has no effect. Also, the ArticulationBody must be movable (cannot be immovable).  
  
[ForceMode.Force](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.Force.html) and [ForceMode.Acceleration](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.Acceleration.html) modes modify the Linear Velocity Per Second accumulator and [ForceMode.Impulse](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.Impulse.html) and [ForceMode.VelocityChange](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.VelocityChange.html) modify the Linear Velocity Per Step accumulator. Mixing these 2 groups of ForceModes doesn't work for Articulation Bodies and will result in only the Linear Velocity Per Second accumulator being applied.  
  
For more information on how ForceMode affects velocity, see [Rigidbody.AddForce](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html).  
  
By default the ArticulationBody's state is set to awake when a force is applied, unless the force is [Vector3.zero](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-zero.html).   
Unit of measurement - N (newtons).

This example applies a forward force to the GameObject's ArticulationBody.
