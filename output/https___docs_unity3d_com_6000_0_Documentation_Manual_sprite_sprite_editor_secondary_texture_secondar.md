Add a secondary texture
# Sprite editor secondary textures
The **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) Editorâ€™s **Secondary Textures** module can associate additional Textures with edited sprites. A **Shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) can then sample these secondary Textures to apply additional effects on the Sprite, such as normal mapping. Secondary Textures are currently only supported by **Sprite Renderers** A component that lets you display images as Sprites for use in both 2D and 3D scenes. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/renderer/renderer-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SpriteRenderer) and are not available for other Renderer components.
