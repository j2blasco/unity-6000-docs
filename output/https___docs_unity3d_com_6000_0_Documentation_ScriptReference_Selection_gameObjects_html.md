gameObjects; 
### Description
Returns the actual game object selection. Includes Prefabs, non-modifiable objects.
When working with objects that are primarily in a Scene, it is strongly recommended to use [Selection.transforms](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Selection-transforms.html) instead.
