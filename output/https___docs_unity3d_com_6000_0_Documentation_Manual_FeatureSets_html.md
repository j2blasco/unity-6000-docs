2D feature set
# Feature sets
Feature sets are groups of [packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PackagesList.html)Packages are collections of assets to be shared and re-used in Unity. The [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui.html) (UPM) can display, add, and remove packages from your project. These packages are native to the Unity Package Manager and provide a fundamental method of delivering Unity functionality. However, the Unity Package Manager can also display [Asset Store packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStorePackages.html) that you downloaded from the Asset Store. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Packages.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Packages) that enable you to achieve specific results in Unity. For example, the 2D **feature set** provides all the functionality you need to create 2D games for various art styles.
All the packages in a feature set are compatible with each other for that version of the feature set. You can install feature sets using the [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/fs-install.html).
