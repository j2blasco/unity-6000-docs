# Relative Joint 2D
Techniques and resources for working with Relative **Joint** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint) 2D components.

[Relative Joint 2D fundamentals](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/relative-joint-2d-fundamentals.html) | Understand the **Relative Joint 2D** A 2D joint that allows two game objects controlled by Rigidbody physics to maintain in a position based on each other’s location. Use this joint to keep two objects offset from each other, at a position and angle you decide [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/relative-joint-2d-reference.html)
