# Undo
The **Undo History** window provides a visual way of navigating through your undo history, or undoing or redoing multiple actions in the Editor at once.
## Undoing and redoing actions
To open the **Undo History** window, click the Undo icon (![](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/undo-icon.png)), or choose **Edit** > **Undo History**.
Select an entry in the **Undo History** window to revert your project back to that point automatically.
Once you have selected an action, redoable actions are indicated with a red line. Click any of the actions to add them back.
## Changing action ordering
To change the order that actions are sorted in the Undo window, open the **More Options** (**:**) menu in the **Undo History** window and choose to show the latest action first or last.
