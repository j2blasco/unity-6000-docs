# Tree Hierarchy view UI reference
The **Tree Hierarchy** view shows the groups arranged in vertical levels. For example, in this structure there is a single trunk, and a branch group in a level above it, with eight branches: 
![The Tree Hierarchy view showing the tree root node, above it a single trunk, and above that a branch group with eight branches.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/Tree_Hie_Example.png) The Tree Hierarchy view showing the tree root node, above it a single trunk, and above that a branch group with eight branches.
Each level shows its group type with an icon, and has lines connecting it to other levels. The number in the top-right corner is the number of branches or leaves that exist in the group. The eye icon just below the number controls the visibility of the group in the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.
