### Description
Is this cloth enabled?
This is the same as the checkbox next to the component label in the inspector. A disabled cloth component will not update it's physics simulation, so you can use this to suspend the simulation of cloth objects when they are not needed, as cloth simulation is a very CPU-intensive task.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Example()
    {
        GetComponent<Cloth[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Cloth.html)>().enabled = false;
    }
}
