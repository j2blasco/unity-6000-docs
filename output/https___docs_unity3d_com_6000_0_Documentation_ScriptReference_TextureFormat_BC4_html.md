### Description
Compressed one channel (R) texture format.
BC4 format compresses textures to 4 bits per pixel, keeping only the red color channel. It is widely supported on PC and console platforms.  
  
It is a good format to compress single-channel textures like heightfields or masks. For two channel textures, see [BC5](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureFormat.BC5.html).
