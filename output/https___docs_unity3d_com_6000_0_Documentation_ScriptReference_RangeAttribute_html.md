When this attribute is used, the float or int will be shown as a slider in the Inspector instead of the default number field.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // This integer will be shown as a slider,
    // with the range of 1 to 6 in the Inspector
    [Range(1, 6)]
    public int integerRange;  
  
    // This float will be shown as a slider,
    // with the range of 0.2f to 0.8f in the Inspector
