### Description
The frame index of the currently available frame in [VideoPlayer.texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-texture.html).
The frame index is 0 for the first frame of the clip, 1 for the second frame, and so on. A frame index of -1 indicates that no valid frame is available.  
  
**Note:** On WebGL, because the frame rate is not known, the frame index assumes a rate of 24FPS. See [VideoPlayer.frameRate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-frameRate.html).
