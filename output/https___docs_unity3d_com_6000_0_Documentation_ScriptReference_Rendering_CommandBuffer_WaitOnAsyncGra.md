## Declaration
public void WaitOnAsyncGraphicsFence([Rendering.GraphicsFence](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.GraphicsFence.html) fence); 
## Declaration
public void WaitOnAsyncGraphicsFence([Rendering.GraphicsFence](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.GraphicsFence.html) fence, [Rendering.SynchronisationStage](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.SynchronisationStage.html) stage); 
## Declaration
public void WaitOnAsyncGraphicsFence([Rendering.GraphicsFence](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.GraphicsFence.html) fence, [Rendering.SynchronisationStageFlags](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.SynchronisationStageFlags.html) stage); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
fence | The [GraphicsFence](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.GraphicsFence.html) the GPU waits for. The `fenceType` of the graphics fence must be [GraphicsFenceType.AsyncQueueSynchronisation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.GraphicsFenceType.AsyncQueueSynchronisation.html).  
stage | Which [SynchronisationStage](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.SynchronisationStage.html) to wait for.  
### Description
Instructs the GPU to pause processing of the queue until it passes through the [GraphicsFence](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.GraphicsFence.html) fence.
This method returns immediately on the CPU. Only GPU processing is affected by the graphics fence.  
  
You can use the `stage` parameter to wait until the start of the next item's vertex or pixel processing. On some platforms, there's a gap between the end of vertex processing and the start of pixel processing in a draw call. If the last command was a compute shader dispatch, Unity ignores `stage`.  
  
This method only works on platforms that support fences. Use [SystemInfo.supportsGraphicsFence](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-supportsGraphicsFence.html) to check if a platform supports fences.  
  
It's possible to create circular dependencies with this function that deadlock the GPU. See [GraphicsFence](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.GraphicsFence.html) for more information.
