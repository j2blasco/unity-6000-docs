stretchingStiffness; 
### Description
Stretching stiffness of the cloth.
Must be greater than zero and smaller or equal to one.  
In many cases, when you want a cloth to be more stiff, actually reducing the number of vertices will get you better results - and performance.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        GetComponent<Cloth[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Cloth.html)>().stretchingStiffness = 1;
    }
}
