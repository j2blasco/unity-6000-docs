# Documentation versions
We continually improve the Unity Editor and Engine in each release. A release can include new features, improvements to existing features, and the removal of old features. Unity’s documentation changes to reflect each release. In addition, each version of the documentation is dynamic and changes over time. We routinely republish the online documentation for the current full release of the Unity Engine to incorporate new content, improvements to existing content, and corrections made in response to user feedback. 
The version of the documentation which corresponds to the newest supported full release of Unity is always available online at **[docs.unity3d.com](https://docs.unity3d.com/)**. 
Make sure you select the documentation version of the User Manual and Scripting API Reference that matches the version of Unity you’re using.
You might need to use an older version of Unity if you’re maintaining a project or in the middle of long-term development on a project. If you’re using an older version of Unity, the installer (offline) documentation matches that version of Unity. However, if you chose not to install local documentation, or want to access the latest published documentation, you can access older versions of the Unity documentation online. 
However, we don’t update and re-publish:
  * The offline installer (offline) documentation.
  * The documentation of Unity versions which are no longer supported. These versions are archived as frozen content.


## Install offline documentation
You can install a local, offline copy of the documentation when you install the Unity software. To install offline documentation, use:
  * The [Unity Download Assistant](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/InstallingUnity.html)
  * The [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/index.html)


You can also download it outside of the installer. For more information, refer to [Offline Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/OfflineDocumentation.html).
