[JointSpring](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointSpring.html) spring; 
### Description
The spring attempts to reach a target angle by adding spring and damping forces.
The [JointSpring.spring](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointSpring-spring.html) force attempts to reach the target angle. A larger value makes the spring reach the target position faster.  
  
The [JointSpring.damper](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointSpring-damper.html) force dampens the angular velocity. A larger value makes the spring reach the goal slower.  
  
The spring reaches for the [JointSpring.targetPosition](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointSpring-targetPosition.html) angle in degrees relative to the rest angle. The rest angle between the bodies is always zero at the beginning of the simulation.

        // Make the spring reach shoot for a 70 degree angle.
        // This could be used to fire off a catapult.  
  
        JointSpring[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointSpring.html) hingeSpring = hinge.spring;
        hingeSpring.spring = 10;
        hingeSpring.damper = 3;
        hingeSpring.targetPosition = 70;
        hinge.spring = hingeSpring;

Modifying the spring does **not** automatically enable it.  
  
Enabling the [motor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint-motor.html) **overrides** the spring, given the spring was enabled. If the motor is again disabled the spring will be restored.
