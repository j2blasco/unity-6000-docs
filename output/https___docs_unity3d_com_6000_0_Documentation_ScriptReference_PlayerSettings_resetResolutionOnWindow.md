resetResolutionOnWindowResize; 
### Description
Indicates whether to reset the application's screen resolution when the native window size changes.
When enabled, if the native window size changes, Unity sets the application's screen resolution to match the new native window size. If you set the **Resolution Scaling Mode** Player Setting to **Fixed DPI**, Unity recalculates the resolution based on the **Fixed DPI** Player Setting property.  
  
This property is relevant for iOS and Android devices.
