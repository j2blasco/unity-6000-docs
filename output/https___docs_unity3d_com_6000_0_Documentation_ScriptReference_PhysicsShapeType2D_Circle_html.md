### Description
Use a circle shape to interpret the [PhysicsShape2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D.html) geometry.
A circle geometry type is comprised of a single vertex in the [PhysicsShape2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D.html) and a [PhysicsShape2D.radius](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D-radius.html). The single vertex represents the center of the circle with the radius defining the radius of the circle.
