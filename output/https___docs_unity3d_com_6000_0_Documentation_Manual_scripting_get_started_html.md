Introduction to scripting
# Get started with scripting
Get started with programming in Unity. Create, name, and edit your first **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts) and set up your development environment to write, test, and debug your Unity C# scripts effectively.
