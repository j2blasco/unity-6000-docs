### Description
Quaternions are used to represent rotations.
A quaternion is a four-tuple of real numbers {x,y,z,w}. A quaternion is a mathematically convenient alternative to the euler angle representation. You can interpolate a quaternion without experiencing gimbal lock. You can also use a quaternion to concatenate a series of rotations into a single representation.  
  
Unity internally uses Quaternions to represent all rotations.  
  
In most cases, you can use existing rotations from methods such as [Transform.localRotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-localRotation.html) or [Transform.rotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-rotation.html) to construct new rotations. For example, use existing rotations to smoothly interpolate between two rotations. The most used Quaternion functions are as follows: [Quaternion.LookRotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.LookRotation.html), [Quaternion.Angle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.Angle.html), [Quaternion.Euler](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.Euler.html), [Quaternion.Slerp](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.Slerp.html), [Quaternion.FromToRotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.FromToRotation.html), and [Quaternion.identity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion-identity.html).  
  
You can use the Quaternion.operator * to rotate one rotation by another, or to rotate a vector by a rotation.  
  
Note that Unity expects Quaternions to be normalized.
