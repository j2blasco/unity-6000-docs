timeSinceLevelLoadAsDouble; 
### Description
The double precision time in seconds since the last non-additive scene finished loading (Read Only).
Double precision version of [timeSinceLevelLoad](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-timeSinceLevelLoad.html). This offers more precision than a float or single value, particularly over extended periods of real-world time. In almost all cases, use the [timeSinceLevelLoadAsDouble](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-timeSinceLevelLoadAsDouble.html) equivalent over [timeSinceLevelLoad](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-timeSinceLevelLoad.html).
