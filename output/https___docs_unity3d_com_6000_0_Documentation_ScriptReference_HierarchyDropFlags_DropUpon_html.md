### Description
Drop a dragged object on the Hierarchy item the mouse is hovering over. The hovered-over item is the dropTargetInstanceID and the dropped object is inserted as a child of the target. This flag is also used when dragging and dropping objects from outside the Hierarchy and into and below the last item in the Hierarchy to add to the Scene. In this case, the dropTargetInstanceID is the Scene handle.
