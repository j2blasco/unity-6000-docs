### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
source | A [RenderTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html) containing the source image.  
destination | The [RenderTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html) to update with the modified image.  
### Description
[Event function](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/event-functions.html) that Unity calls after a [Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) has finished rendering, that allows you to modify the Camera's final image.
In the Built-in Render Pipeline, Unity calls `OnRenderImage` on MonoBehaviours that are attached to the same GameObject as an enabled [Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) component, after the Camera finished rendering. You can use `OnRenderImage` to create a fullscreen post-processing effect. These effects work by reading the pixels from the source image, using a Unity shader to modify the appearance of the pixels, and then rendering the result into the destination image. You would typically use [Graphics.Blit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.Blit.html) to perform these steps.  
  
If multiple scripts on the same Camera implement `OnRenderImage`, Unity calls them in the order that they appear in the Camera Inspector window, starting from the top. The `destination` of one operation is the `source` of the next one; internally, Unity creates one or more temporary RenderTextures to store these intermediate results.  
  
On Android, to avoid banding or to use alpha in fullscreen effects, set [PlayerSettings.use32BitDisplayBuffer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings-use32BitDisplayBuffer.html) to `true`.  
  
`OnRenderImage` is not supported in the Scriptable Render Pipeline. To create custom fullscreen effects in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), use the [ScriptableRenderPass](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.Rendering.Universal.ScriptableRenderPass.html) API. To create custom fullscreen effects in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), use a [Fullscreen Custom Pass](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Custom-Pass.html).  
  
For information about using Unity's pre-built post-processing effects, see [Post-processing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PostProcessingOverview.html).

    {
        // Read pixels from the source RenderTexture[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html), apply the material, copy the updated results to the destination RenderTexture[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html)
        Graphics.Blit[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.Blit.html)(src, dest, mat);
