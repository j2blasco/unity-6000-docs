# Refunding your customers
Customers might contact you to request a refund on your **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore) package. However, because they made purchases through the Asset Store, the store manages refunds, not individual publishers.
If the user has an issue that you can solve, then you should do everything you can to resolve your customer’s issue. If your customer has a logical reason to want a refund and it doesn’t violate the Asset Store’s [Refund Requirements](https://unity3d.com/legal/as_provider), then you must request a refund from [the Asset Store](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=65905) on the customer’s behalf.
**Note:** The Unity Asset Store does not give refunds without your authorization unless there has been a server error where the customer was charged for duplicate Assets by mistake, or another similar error.
To request a refund from the Asset Store on the customer’s behalf:
  1. Ask the user to provide you with the invoice they received when they purchased the Asset Store package.
  2. Navigate to the **Verify Invoice** tab of the [Asset Store Publisher](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/) portal.
![Verify Invoice screen of the Asset Store.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetStoreRefunding.png) Verify Invoice screen of the Asset Store.
  3. If you don’t see the invoice in the list, enter the invoice number in the **Invoice No.** text box and click the **Verify** button.
  4. Once verified, [submit a request to Unity](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=65905), and fill out the following information:
     * **Your email address** (use an email address attached to your publisher account)
     * **Subject** (for example, “Request for an Asset Store refund”)
     * **Description** : Use this field to pass on any relevant information about why the customer has requested a refund. If you are not attaching an invoice, also indicate the invoice number in this field.
     * **Attachments** : Attach the customer’s invoice here.
