inertia; 
### Description
The Rigidbody's resistance to changes in angular velocity (rotation).
Rotational inertia controls a Rigidbody's resistance to changes in [angularVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-angularVelocity.html). It is similar to how [mass](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-mass.html) controls a Rigidbody's resistance to changes in [linearVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-linearVelocity.html).  
  
The rotational inertia is automatically calculated based on the Rigidbody's [mass](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-mass.html) position relative to the [centerOfMass](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-centerOfMass.html). It can also be specified explicitly by setting this property in the same way [mass](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-mass.html) can be set.
