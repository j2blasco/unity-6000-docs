### Description
Provides a static implementation of [ObjectPool<T0>](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.ObjectPool_1.html).
This is an alternative to [GenericPool<T0>](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.GenericPool_1.html) which has collection checks disabled. Some objects generate garbage when they are compared during the collection checks. This version does not perform any collection checks so no garbage will be generated. Note this is not thread-safe.
```
using UnityEngine.Pool;  
  
public class UnsafeGenericPoolPoolExample
{
    class MyClass
    {
        public int someValue;
        public string someString;
    }  
  
    void GetPooled()
    {
        // Get an instance
        var instance = UnsafeGenericPool<MyClass>.Get();  
  
        // Return the instance
        UnsafeGenericPool<MyClass>.Release(instance);
    }
}
