### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
screenRect | Rectangle on the screen to use for the texture. In pixel coordinates with (0,0) in the upper-left corner.  
texture |  [Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.html) to draw.  
sourceRect | Region of the texture to use. In normalized coordinates with (0,0) in the bottom-left corner.  
leftBorder | Number of pixels from the left that are not affected by scale.  
rightBorder | Number of pixels from the right that are not affected by scale.  
topBorder | Number of pixels from the top that are not affected by scale.  
bottomBorder | Number of pixels from the bottom that are not affected by scale.  
color |  [Color](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color.html) that modulates the output. The neutral value is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5). Set as vertex color for the shader.  
mat | Custom [Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html) that can be used to draw the texture. Unity passes the texture into the shader as `_MainTex`. If null is passed, a default material with the Internal-GUITexture.shader is used.  
pass | If -1 (default), draws all passes in the material. Otherwise, draws given pass only.  
### Description
Draw a texture in screen coordinates.
If you want to draw a texture from inside of OnGUI code, you should only do that from [EventType.Repaint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EventType.Repaint.html) events. It's probably better to use [GUI.DrawTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.DrawTexture.html) for GUI code.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Draws a texture on the screen at 10, 10 with 100 width, 100 height.  
  
    Texture[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.html) aTexture;  
  
    void OnGUI()
    {
        if (Event.current.type.Equals(EventType.Repaint[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EventType.Repaint.html)))
        {
            Graphics.DrawTexture[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.DrawTexture.html)(new Rect[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html)(10, 10, 100, 100), aTexture);
        }
    }
}
```
