labelWidth; 
### Description
The width in pixels reserved for labels of Editor GUI controls.
Editor GUI controls have a certain width allocated for labels. This width can be changed by setting labelWidth to a different value. Setting it to 0 will reset the label width to the default value. The default value can vary, for example depending on the width of the Inspector window.
