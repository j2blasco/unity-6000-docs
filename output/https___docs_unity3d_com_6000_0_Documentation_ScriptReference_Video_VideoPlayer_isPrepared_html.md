isPrepared; 
### Description
Returns whether the [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) has successfully prepared the content to be played. 
A prepared VideoPlayer can play back the content instantly because preliminary parsing and buffering has been done.  
  
A VideoPlayer starts out as not prepared (`false`). To prepare the VideoPlayer, you need to use [VideoPlayer.Prepare](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.Prepare.html). When preparation is done, the VideoPlayer emits the [VideoPlayer.prepareCompleted](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-prepareCompleted.html) event, which sets `isPrepared` to `true`.   
  
The property goes back to `false` when you or the VideoPlayer calls [VideoPlayer.Stop](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.Stop.html).  
  
If there are preparation failures, this property might never be set to `true`. In this case, Unity sends an error description through the [VideoPlayer.errorReceived](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-errorReceived.html) event.
