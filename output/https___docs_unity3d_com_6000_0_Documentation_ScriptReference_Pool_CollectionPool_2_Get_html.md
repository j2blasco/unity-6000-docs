### Returns
**TCollection** A pooled object or a new instance if the pool is empty. 
### Description
Get an instance from the pool. If the pool is empty then a new instance will be created.
```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Pool;  
  
// This example shows how both version of Get could be used to simplify a line of points.
public class Simplify2DLine
{
    public List<Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)> SimplifyLine(Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)[] points)
    {
        // This version will only be returned to the pool if we call Release on it.
        var simplifiedPoints = CollectionPool<List<Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)>, Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)>.Get();  
  
        // Copy the points into a temp list so we can pass them into the Simplify method
        // When the pooled object leaves the scope it will be Disposed and returned to the pool automatically.
        // This version is ideal for working with temporary lists.
        using (CollectionPool<List<Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)>, Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)>.Get(out List<Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)> tempList))
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < points.Length; ++i)
            {
                tempList.Add(points[i]);
            }
