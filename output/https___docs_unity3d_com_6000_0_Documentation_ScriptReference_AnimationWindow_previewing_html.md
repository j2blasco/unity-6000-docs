### Description
This property toggles previewing in the Animation window.
Previewing allows the Animation window to update the animated Game Object hierarchy in the Scene View with animated values. Disabling this also disables [AnimationWindow.recording](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationWindow-recording.html) and [AnimationWindow.playing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationWindow-playing.html).
