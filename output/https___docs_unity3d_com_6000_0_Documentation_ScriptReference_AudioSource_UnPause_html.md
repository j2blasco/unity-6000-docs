## Declaration
public void UnPause(); 
### Description
Unpause the paused playback of this AudioSource.
This function is similar to if you call Play() on a paused AudioSource, except that it will not create a new playback voice if it is not currently paused.  
  
This is also useful if you have paused one-shots and want to resume playback without creating a new playback voice for the attached AudioClip.  
  
If you use `UnPause` on an AudioSource that hasn't played before or has stopped, the audio will not play. This is because `UnPause` resumes the clip from when the clip was last paused. You need to play and then pause the clip before you can unpause it.
```

// The Audio Source component has an AudioClip[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioClip.html) option.  The audio
// played in this example comes from AudioClip[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioClip.html) and is called audioData.
