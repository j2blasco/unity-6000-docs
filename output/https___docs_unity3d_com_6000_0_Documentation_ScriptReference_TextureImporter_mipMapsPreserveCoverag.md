mipMapsPreserveCoverage; 
### Description
Enables or disables coverage-preserving alpha mipmapping.
Enable this to rescale the alpha values of computed mipmaps so coverage is preserved. This means a higher percentage of pixels passes the alpha test and lower mipmap levels do not become more transparent. This is disabled by default (set to false).
