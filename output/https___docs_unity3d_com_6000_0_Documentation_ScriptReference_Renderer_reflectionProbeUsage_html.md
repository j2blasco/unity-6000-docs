[Rendering.ReflectionProbeUsage](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.ReflectionProbeUsage.html) reflectionProbeUsage; 
### Description
Should reflection probes be used for this Renderer?
If enabled and reflection probes are present in the Scene, a reflection texture will be picked for this object and set as a built-in shader uniform variable. Surface shaders use this information automatically.
