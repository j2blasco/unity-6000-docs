paddingPower; 
### Description
The amount of extra padding between packed sprites.
Expressed as the power of 2 minus 1 (i.e. paddingPower of 0 enforces a 2 pixel gap between, paddingPower of 1 - 4 pixel gap, paddingPower of 2 - 8 pixel gap, etc.). This can be used to prevent sprites from bleeding into each other in lower mip levels.
