isDirectDependency; 
### Description
If the package is a direct dependency of the project.
Direct dependencies are packages that you have explicitly included in your project, either by adding them using the package manager, or including them in the manifest file. They are called a direct dependency because your project is explicitly dependent on them.  
  
Indirect dependencies are packages which are also installed in your project, but only because they are a dependency of another package in your project.
