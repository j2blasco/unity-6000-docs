public class ContextTesting : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    /// Add a context menu named "Do Something" in the inspector
    /// of the attached script.
    [ContextMenu[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ContextMenu.html)("Do Something")]
    void DoSomething()
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Perform operation");
