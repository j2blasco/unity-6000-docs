[UIElements.LanguageDirection](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.LanguageDirection.html) languageDirection; 
### Description
Indicates the directionality of the element's text. The value will propagate to the element's children. 
Setting `languageDirection` to `RTL` can only get the basic RTL support like text reversal. To get more comprehensive RTL support, such as line breaking, word wrapping, or text shaping, you must enable [Advance Text Generator](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UIE-advanced-text-generator.html).
