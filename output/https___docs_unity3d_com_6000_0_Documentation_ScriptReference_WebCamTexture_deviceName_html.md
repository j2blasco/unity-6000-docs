deviceName; 
### Description
Set this to specify the name of the device to use.
This only has an effect when set while the camera is not running.  
  
Note: if you want to use WebCamTexture to get the camera stream from device connected through Unity Remote, then you must initalize it through the constructor. It's not possible to change device using [WebCamTexture.deviceName](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WebCamTexture-deviceName.html) from regular devices to remote devices and vice versa.
```
