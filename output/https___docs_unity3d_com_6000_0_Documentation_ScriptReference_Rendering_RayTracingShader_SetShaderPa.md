## Declaration
public void SetShaderPass(string passName); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
passName | The Shader Pass to use when executing ray tracing shaders.  
### Description
Selects which Shader Pass to use when executing ray/geometry intersection shaders.
This name is specified in the ShaderLab shaders used by Materials applied to Renderers used in ray tracing. If a shader doesn't have a Shader Pass with the specified name, then no ray/geometry intersection code is executed. This method must be called before calling RayTracingShader.DispatchRays.  
  
The Shader Pass code can include optional closest hit or any hit shaders.  
  
For procedural ray-traced geometries, an intersection shader must be authored. The engine code will automatically enable a keywork named `RAY_TRACING_PROCEDURAL_GEOMETRY` if the geometry is proceduraly ray-traced.  
  
The following example shader code returns the color red. 
```
SubShader
{
    Pass[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ShaderData.Pass.html)
    {
        // RayTracingShader.SetShaderPass[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RayTracingShader.SetShaderPass.html) must use this name in order to execute the ray tracing shaders from this Pass[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ShaderData.Pass.html).
        Name "Test"  
  
        // Add tags to identify the shaders to use for ray tracing.

        struct AttributeData
        {
            float2 barycentrics;
        };  
  
        struct RayPayload
        {
            float4 color;
        };

        {

            attr.barycentrics = float2(0, 0);
            ReportHit(0, 0, attr);
        }
#endif
