## Declaration
public static float Angle([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) from, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) to); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
from | The vector from which the angular difference is measured.  
to | The vector to which the angular difference is measured.  
### Returns
**float** The angle in degrees between the two vectors. 
### Description
Calculates the angle between two vectors.
The angle returned is the angle of rotation from the first vector to the second, when treating these two vector inputs as directions.  
Note: The angle returned will always be between 0 and 180 degrees, because the method returns the smallest angle between the vectors. That is, it will never return a reflex angle.
