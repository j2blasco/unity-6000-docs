# Purchase or download a package from the Asset Store
Approximately 10% of the **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore)’s content is free to download. The price of paid content ranges from $5 to $3500, depending on the size and scope of the offering. Many publishers provide a “lite” version of their package. These packages are available for free or at a reduced rate, so you can determine if they meet your needs.
If you don’t have a Unity account, you need to create one before you can get a package from the Asset Store. If you already have a Unity ID for the Unity Hub or the Unity Editor, use the same ID for your Unity Asset Store account.
After you get a package from the Asset Store, sign in to the Hub or Editor with the same Unity ID you used on the Asset Store. Then, use the Package Manager window to add those Asset Store packages to your projects.
## Create a Unity account
To create a new Unity account, go to [Create a Unity ID](https://id.unity.com/account/new) and follow the instructions. You can also open the Unity Asset Store, select the user account icon, then select **Create a Unity Account** :
![If you select Sign In, the Unity ID login appears with another link to Create a Unity Account.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetStoreCreateUnityID.png) If you select **Sign In** , the Unity ID login appears with another link to **Create a Unity Account**.
## Find packages on the Asset Store
When you open the Asset Store in a web browser, the main page displays current sales promotions and a curated list of **Popular Assets**.
You can browse through the suggestions, or search for something specific. If you’re looking for a specific asset, you can use any of these searching, filtering, and sorting methods alone or in combination:
  * Search by name or keyword. For example: 
    * Search for something specific, such as “fox family”.
    * Search for “FBX” to find any packages containing FBX models or tools.
    * Search for “demo” to browse for any packages with “demo” in the title.
  * Choose a category of related Asset Store packages to browse from, such as **3D** , **Audio** , **VFX** , and more.
  * If you choose a category, you can refine the results by using the filter sidebar. For example, you can select the **Audio** main category and then select the **Sound FX** subcategory.
  * Use any combination of the items on the filter sidebar to narrow down the list of Asset Store packages. For example, setting the following options narrows down the list of suggestions to include Unity’s 3D packages for iOS: 
    * **All Categories** : select **3D**
    * **Unity Versions** : select **Unity 2019.x**
    * **Publisher** : search for “unity” and select **Unity Technologies**
    * **Platforms** : select **iOS**
  * Choose a sort method from the **Sort by** menu. You can sort by relevance, popularity, rating, publish or update date, name, or price.


**Tip** : If you need to start over, select **clear filters** at the top of the filter sidebar to reset all filter options to their default values.
