## Declaration
public bool DrawDefaultInspector(); 
### Returns
**bool** Returns true if any GUI controls in the default Inspector changed the value of the input data, otherwise returns false. 
### Description
Draws the built-in Inspector.
Call this method, within the OnInspectorGUI method, to automatically draw the Inspector. This is useful if you want to add a few buttons without having to redo the entire Inspector. Additional resources: [OnInspectorGUI](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.OnInspectorGUI.html).
