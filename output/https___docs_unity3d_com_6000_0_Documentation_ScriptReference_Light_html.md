### Description
Script interface for [light components](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Light.html).
Use this to control all aspects of Unity's lights. The properties are an exact match for the values shown in the Inspector.  
  
For more information about shadow maps, refer to [Shadow Mapping](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shadow-mapping.html).  
  
Usually lights are just created in the editor, but sometimes you want to create a light from a script:
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Make a game object
        GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) lightGameObject = new GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html)("The Light[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light.html)");  
  
        // Add the light component
        Light[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light.html) lightComp = lightGameObject.AddComponent<Light[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light.html)>();  
  
        // Set color and position
        lightComp.color = Color.blue[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color-blue.html);  
  
        // Set the position (or any transform property)
        lightGameObject.transform.position = new Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html)(0, 5, 0);
    }
}

```

### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[areaSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-areaSize.html) | The size of the area light.  
[bakingOutput](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-bakingOutput.html) | This property describes the output of the last Global Illumination bake.  
[bounceIntensity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-bounceIntensity.html) | The multiplier that defines the strength of the bounce lighting.  
[boundingSphereOverride](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-boundingSphereOverride.html) | Bounding sphere used to override the regular light bounding sphere during culling.  
[color](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-color.html) | Specifies the color emitted by the light.  
[colorTemperature](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-colorTemperature.html) |  The color temperature of the light. Correlated Color Temperature (abbreviated as CCT) is multiplied with the color filter when calculating the final color of a light source. The color temperature of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from an ideal black body is defined as its surface temperature in Kelvin. White is 6500K according to the D65 standard. A candle light is 1800K and a soft warm light bulb is 2700K. If you want to use colorTemperature, GraphicsSettings.lightsUseLinearIntensity and Light.useColorTemperature has to be enabled. Additional resources: GraphicsSettings.lightsUseLinearIntensity, GraphicsSettings.useColorTemperature.   
[commandBufferCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-commandBufferCount.html) | Number of command buffers set up on this light (Read Only).  
[cookie](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-cookie.html) | The cookie texture projected by the light.  
[cookieSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-cookieSize.html) | The size of a directional light's cookie.  
[cullingMask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-cullingMask.html) | This is used to light certain objects in the Scene selectively.  
[dilatedRange](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-dilatedRange.html) |  The Light.range property describes the range of each point on the light. However, area lights consist of several light-emitting points, and so the effective range is a bit larger, and depends on the size of the area light. This property returns this larger range. Use this property to find whether a given world-space point will be lit by the area light. If not an area light, then returns the same value as Light.range.   
[enableSpotReflector](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-enableSpotReflector.html) | Wether a Spot Light should simulate having a reflector.  
[flare](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-flare.html) | The flare asset to use for this light.  
[forceVisible](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-forceVisible.html) | Force a light to be visible even if outside the view frustum.  
[innerSpotAngle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-innerSpotAngle.html) | The angle of the spot light's inner cone in degrees.  
[intensity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-intensity.html) | The Intensity of a light is multiplied with the Light color.  
[layerShadowCullDistances](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-layerShadowCullDistances.html) | Per-light, per-layer shadow culling distances. Directional lights only.   
[lightmapBakeType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-lightmapBakeType.html) | This property describes what part of a light's contribution can be baked (Editor only).  
[lightShadowCasterMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-lightShadowCasterMode.html) | Allows you to override the global Shadowmask Mode per light. Only use this with render pipelines that can handle per light Shadowmask modes. Incompatible with the legacy renderers.  
[lightUnit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-lightUnit.html) | The unit Light.intensity should be displayed in.  
[luxAtDistance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-luxAtDistance.html) | How far away to measure LightUnit.Lux from.  
[range](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-range.html) |  The range of each point of the light. Since area lights have a light emitting surface instead of a single point, the cumulative range of the light is larger than this property. This larger range can be read from the Light.dilatedRange property. For non-area lights, Light.range and Light.dilatedRange return the same value.   
[renderingLayerMask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-renderingLayerMask.html) | Determines which rendering LayerMask this Light affects.  
[renderMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-renderMode.html) | Controls how often the light's contribution is calculated during rendering.  
[shadowAngle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-shadowAngle.html) | Controls the amount of artificial softening applied to the edges of shadows cast by directional lights (Editor only).  
[shadowBias](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-shadowBias.html) | Shadow mapping constant bias.  
[shadowCustomResolution](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-shadowCustomResolution.html) | The custom resolution of the shadow map.  
[shadowMatrixOverride](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-shadowMatrixOverride.html) | Matrix that overrides the regular light projection matrix during shadow culling. Unity uses this matrix if you set Light.useShadowMatrixOverride to true.  
[shadowNearPlane](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-shadowNearPlane.html) | Near plane value to use for shadow frustums.  
[shadowNormalBias](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-shadowNormalBias.html) | Shadow mapping normal-based bias.  
[shadowRadius](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-shadowRadius.html) | Controls the amount of artificial softening applied to the edges of shadows cast by the Point or Spot light (Editor only).  
[shadowResolution](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-shadowResolution.html) | The resolution of the shadow map. Change it to balance shadow visual quality and performance.  
[shadows](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-shadows.html) | Determines if this light will cast soft or hard shadows, or not cast shadows at all.
