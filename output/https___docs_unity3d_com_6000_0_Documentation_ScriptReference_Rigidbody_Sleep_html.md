## Declaration
public void Sleep(); 
### Description
Forces a rigidbody to sleep until woken up.
A Rigidbody can be put to sleep only if it is not in contact with an awake rigidbody, and if it does not come in contact with any rigidbody during the next simulation step. A common use is to call this from Awake in order to make a rigidbody sleep at startup. See the [Rigidbodies Overview](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RigidbodiesOverview.html) in the manual for more information about Rigidbody sleeping.
