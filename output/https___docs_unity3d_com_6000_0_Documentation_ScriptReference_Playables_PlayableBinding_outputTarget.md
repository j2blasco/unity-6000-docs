outputTargetType; 
### Description
The type of target required by the [PlayableOutput](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Playables.PlayableOutput.html) for this PlayableBinding.
For example, the [AnimationPlayableBinding.Create](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animations.AnimationPlayableBinding.Create.html) method returns a PlayableBinding where the outputTargetType is typeof(Animator). If the binding represents a [ScriptPlayableOutput](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Playables.ScriptPlayableOutput.html), the outputTargetType corresponds with the type parameter passed in [ScriptPlayableOutput.Create](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Playables.ScriptPlayableOutput.Create.html).
