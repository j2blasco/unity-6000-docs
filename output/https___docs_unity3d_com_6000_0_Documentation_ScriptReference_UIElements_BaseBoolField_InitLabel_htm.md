## Declaration
protected void InitLabel(); 
### Description
Initializes the Label element whenever the [BaseBoolField.text](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.BaseBoolField-text.html) property changes. 
Override this method to modify the Label after its creation. You must call the base implementation of this method before trying to access to m_Label property in your own implementation.
