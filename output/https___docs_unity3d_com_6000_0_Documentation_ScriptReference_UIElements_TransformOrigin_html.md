### Description
Represents the point of origin where the transformations ([Scale](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Scale.html), [Translate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Translate.html), and [Rotate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Rotate.html)) are applied. 
By default, transform-origin is set in percentages relative to the element's size. For example, 50% 50% sets the origin to the center of the element. These percentages are calculated based on the elementâ€™s resulting layout size (resolvedStyle.height and resolvedStyle.width). You can also specify transform-origin in pixels. The origin is determined based on the local coordinate system of the element, where the top-left corner is considered the origin point (0,0) regardless of whether you use percentages or pixels. Negative values and values larger than 100% are valid and move the transform-origin outside the element.
