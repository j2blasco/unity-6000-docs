### Description
When the [Joint2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.html) breaks, call [Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D.html) but take no other action.
NOTE: With this option selected, continuing to break the joint will continue to cause the [Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D.html) callback to be called.
