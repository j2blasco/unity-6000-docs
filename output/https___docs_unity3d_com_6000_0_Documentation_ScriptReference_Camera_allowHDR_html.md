allowHDR; 
### Description
High dynamic range rendering.
True if the camera is using HDR rendering and false if it is not. You can only enable HDR if it is also supported by the current [GraphicsTier](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.GraphicsTier.html). You can only set a Graphics Tier in the Built-in Render Pipeline.
