enabledInHierarchy; 
### Description
Returns true if the [VisualElement](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.VisualElement.html) is enabled in its own hierarchy. 
This flag verifies if the element is enabled globally. A parent disabling its child VisualElement affects this variable.
