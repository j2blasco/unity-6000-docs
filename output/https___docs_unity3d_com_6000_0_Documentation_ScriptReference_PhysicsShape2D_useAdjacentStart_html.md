useAdjacentStart; 
### Description
When the value is true, then the shape will use the [adjacentStart](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D-adjacentStart.html) feature. When the value is false, then the shape will not use the [adjacentStart](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D-adjacentEnd.html) feature.
This property is identical to [EdgeCollider2D.useAdjacentStartPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EdgeCollider2D-useAdjacentStartPoint.html).  
  
**NOTE** : This property is only used when the [shapeType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D-shapeType.html) is [PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges.html).
