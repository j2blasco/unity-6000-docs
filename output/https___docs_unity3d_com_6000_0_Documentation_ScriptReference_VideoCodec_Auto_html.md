### Description
Choose the codec that supports hardware decoding on the target platform.
Unity automatically selects the best available codec based on the current platform and video file format. This is the default setting. For more information about video encoding, refer to [Video encoding compatibility reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/video-encoding-compatibility.html).
