### Description
Legacy bounding box method.
Calculates ascent values by using the highest value of the top of the bounding boxes for the glyphs in the font's character set. For character sets other than dynamic, this can result in smaller ascent values, as not all glyphs will be considered. This mode is available for backward compatibility.
