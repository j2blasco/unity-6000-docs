### Description
Unity raises this event when the editor application is quitting.
Add an event handler to this event to receive a notification that the application is quitting.  
  
Note that this will not fire if the Editor is forced to quit or if there is a crash. This event is raised when the quitting process cannot be cancelled.  
  
To prevent the EditorApplication from quitting look at the [EditorApplication.wantsToQuit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorApplication-wantsToQuit.html) event.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);  
  
// Ensure class initializer is called whenever scripts recompile
[InitializeOnLoad]
public class EditorQuitExample
{
    static void Quit()
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Quitting the Editor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.html)");
    }  
  
    static EditorQuitExample()
    {
        EditorApplication.quitting[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorApplication-quitting.html) += Quit;
    }
}

```
