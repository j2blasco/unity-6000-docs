### Description
Suspends the coroutine execution for the given amount of seconds using unscaled time.
See [WaitForSeconds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WaitForSeconds.html) if you wish to wait using scaled time.  
WaitForSecondsRealtime can only be used with a `yield` statement in coroutines.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class WaitForSecondsExample : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        StartCoroutine(Example());
    }  
  
    IEnumerator Example()
    {
        print(Time.time[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-time.html));
        yield return new WaitForSecondsRealtime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WaitForSecondsRealtime.html)(5);
        print(Time.time[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-time.html));
    }
