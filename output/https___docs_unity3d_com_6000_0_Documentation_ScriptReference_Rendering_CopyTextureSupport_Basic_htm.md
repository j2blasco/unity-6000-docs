### Description
Basic [Graphics.CopyTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.CopyTexture.html) support.
Generally this means that texture copies work between same texture types (e.g. 2D texture to 2D texture, or cubemap to cubemap). Additional cases that might not necessarily be present are other flags in [CopyTextureSupport](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CopyTextureSupport.html).
