# Set up your environment for UWP
To create a Unity application for Universal Windows Platform (UWP), you first need to set up your Unity project to support UWP. To support UWP, a Unity project requires the **UWP Build Support** module.
Before you get started, check [UWP Requirements and compatibility](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/uwp-requirements-and-compatibility.html) to make sure youâ€™re aware of any limitations for developing a Unity application for this platform.
## Install dependencies
Unity distributes dependencies as [modules](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/AddModules.html) which means you use the [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/index.html) to install them. The module you need is **UWP Build Support**. You can install it either when you install a new Unity Editor version, or add it to an existing Unity Editor install. To install modules:
  * At install time, refer to [Downloading and installing Editors and modules with the Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallEditors.html).
  * To an existing install, refer to [Add modules](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/AddModules.html).
