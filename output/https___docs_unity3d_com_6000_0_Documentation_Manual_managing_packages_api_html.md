Scripting API for packages
# Package management with the scripting API
Use the Package Manager scripting API to interact with the Package Manager through C# **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts).
For example, you might want to install a specific package or version of a package depending on the platform of the target device.
