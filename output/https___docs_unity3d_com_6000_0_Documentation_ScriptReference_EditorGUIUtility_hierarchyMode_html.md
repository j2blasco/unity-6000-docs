### Description
Is the Editor GUI in hierarchy mode?
In hierarchy mode, [EditorGUI.Foldout](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorGUI.Foldout.html) controls are positioned with the foldout triangle to the left of the specified [Rect](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html) for the control, rather than being inside the Rect. This way, the label of the foldout is aligned together with labels of other Editor GUI controls.
