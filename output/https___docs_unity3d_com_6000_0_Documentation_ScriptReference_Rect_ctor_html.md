Note: Rect represents an abstract rectangle, and can be used in a variety of situations. As such, Rects don't have an explicit top, bottom, left or right. For example, Y values in Camera space are measured from the bottom of the screen, but Y values in Editor GUI space are measured from the top of the window, therefore whether the Y value of a Rect is its "top" or "bottom" will vary depending on where you use the Rect value. You can refer to the corners by using [Rect.min](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect-min.html) and [Rect.max](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect-max.html).

## Declaration
public Rect([Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) position, [Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) size); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
position | The position of the minimum corner of the rect.  
size | The width and height of the rect.  
### Description
Creates a rectangle given a size and position.
This form of the constructor is convenient when you are already working with Vector2 values.
