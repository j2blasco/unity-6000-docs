# UI Toolkit project settings
To view the UI Toolkit project settings, go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **UI Toolkit**.
## UI Builder
When you create a new UI Document (UXML) in the UI Builder, certain features are set by default:
  * The UI Document is set to suit runtime UI.
  * The UI Builder library only displays UI controls that are available for runtime UI.
  * You can easily zoom in and out of the canvas of the **Viewport** The userâ€™s visible area of an app on their screen.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Viewport) window in UI Builder using your mouse wheel or trackpad.


To ensure that newly created documents are, by default, compatible with Editor UI and that the UI Builder library displays the additional controls for Editor UI, select **Enable Editor Extension Authoring by Default**. For more information, refer to [Enable Editor Extension Authoring for UI Documents (UXML)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UIB-interface-overview.html#enable-editor-extension-authoring-for-ui-documents-uxml).
To disable zooming on your canvas using your mouse wheel or trackpad, select **Disable Viewport Zooming via Mouse Wheel/Trackpad**.
## Advanced
The UI Toolkit Event Debugger is an experimental feature that helps you to discover how various UI Toolkit events, such as input, layout, and paint, are handled. The **UI Toolkit Event Debugger** window is disabled by default. To enable it, Select **Enable Event Debugger**. To access it once enabled, select **Windows** > **UI Toolkit** > **Event Debugger**.
The UI Toolkit Layout Debugger is an experimental feature that helps you to discover what styles and settings affect an element on the screen. The **UI Toolkit Layout Debugger** window is disabled by default. To enable it, Select **Enable Layout Debugger**. To access it once enabled, select **Windows** > **UI Toolkit** > **Layout Debugger**.
