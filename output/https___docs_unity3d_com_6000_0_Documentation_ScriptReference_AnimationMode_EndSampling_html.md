public static void EndSampling(); 
### Description
Finish the sampling of the animation clip.
[EndSampling](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationMode.EndSampling.html) is called after [SampleAnimationClip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationMode.SampleAnimationClip.html) returns. This function must be called immediately following [SampleAnimationClip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationMode.SampleAnimationClip.html). See the script example on the [AnimationMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationMode.html) page to see this behaviour.
