### Description
The GameObject is not shown in the Hierarchy, not saved to the Scene, and not unloaded by [Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.html).
This is most commonly used for GameObjects which are created by a script and are purely under the script's control.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Creates a Material[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html) that is explicitly created & destroyed by the component.
    // Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.html) will not unload it, and it will not be editable by the Inspector.
    private Material[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html) ownedMaterial;
    void OnEnable()
    {
        ownedMaterial = new Material[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html)(Shader.Find[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Shader.Find.html)("Diffuse"));
        ownedMaterial.hideFlags = HideFlags.HideAndDontSave[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.HideAndDontSave.html);
        GetComponent<Renderer[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer.html)>().sharedMaterial = ownedMaterial;
    }  
  
    // Objects created as hide and don't save must be explicitly destroyed by the owner of the object.
    void OnDisable()
    {
        DestroyImmediate(ownedMaterial);
    }
}

```
