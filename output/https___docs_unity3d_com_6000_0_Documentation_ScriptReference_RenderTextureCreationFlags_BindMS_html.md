### Description
Setting this flag causes the RenderTexture to be bound as a multisampled texture in a shader. The flag prevents the RenderTexture from being resolved by default when [RenderTexture.antiAliasing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-antiAliasing.html) is greater than 1.
