### Description
The clip being played by the [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html).
The [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) may reference both a clip and a URL at the same time. The last one that was set takes precedence. Setting this to `null` will stop any currently prepared playback.  
  
**Note:** Not supported on WebGL. Only [VideoPlayer.url](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-url.html) is supported on this platform.
