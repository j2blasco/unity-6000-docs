# Create trees with Tree Editor
[Switch to Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Tree.html "Go to Tree page in the Scripting Reference")
Use **Tree Editor** to design trees directly within the Unity Editor. You can create trees from scratch, or by duplicating existing trees. You can also create a tree or leaves from imported meshes.
For most uses, the SpeedTree Modeler replaces the Tree Editor. For backward compatibility with content created before SpeedTree was introduced, use Tree Editor.
Tree Editor works only with the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline). For the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), import from [SpeedTree](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SpeedTree-landing.html).

[**Design a tree**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tree-FirstTree.html) | Design a tree using the Tree Editor. Add materials, **colliders** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collider), and wind.  
[**Create trees and leaves from meshes**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/terrain-Tree-From-Mesh.html) | Create a tree or leaves from an imported **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/mesh.html)
