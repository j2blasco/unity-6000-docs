## Declaration
public bool Create(); 
### Returns
**bool** True if the texture is created, else false. 
### Description
Actually creates the RenderTexture.
RenderTexture constructor does not actually create the hardware texture; by default the texture is created the first time it is set [active](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-active.html). Calling `Create` lets you create it up front. `Create` does nothing if the texture is already created.  
  
The initial contents of a newly created render texture are undefined. On some platforms and APIs the contents will default to black, but you shouldn't depend on this. You can use [LoadStoreActionDebugModeSettings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.LoadStoreActionDebugModeSettings.html) to highlight undefined areas of the display, to help you debug rendering problems on mobile platforms.

```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public RenderTexture[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html) rt;  
  
    void  Start()
    {
        rt = new RenderTexture[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html)(256, 256, 16, RenderTextureFormat.ARGB32[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureFormat.ARGB32.html));
        rt.Create();  
  
        // Add code here to work on the render texture  
  
        // Release the hardware resources used by the render texture
        rt.Release();
    }
}
