### Description
The current time of the animation.
If the time is larger than length it will be wrapped according to wrapMode. The value can be larger than the animations length. In this case playback mode will remap the time before sampling. This value usually goes from 0 to infinity.

using System.Collections;

    void Start()
    {
        // Rewind the walk animation
        anim["Walk"].time = 0.0f;
    }
