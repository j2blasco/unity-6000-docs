Struct describing the result of a Global Illumination bake for a given light.
The example below demonstrates how you can check the baked status of a light and change its active state.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class LightBakingOutputExample : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void TurnOffLight(Light[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light.html) light)
    {
        if (light.bakingOutput.isBaked && light.bakingOutput.lightmapBakeType != LightmapBakeType.Realtime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightmapBakeType.Realtime.html))
        {
            Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Light[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light.html) got some contribution statically baked, it cannot be turned off at runtime.");
        }
        else
        {
            light.enabled = false;
        }
