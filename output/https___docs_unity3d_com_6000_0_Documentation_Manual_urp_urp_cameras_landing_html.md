Introduction to cameras in URP
# Cameras in URP
Resources for using cameras in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).

---|---  
[Introduction to cameras in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/cameras/camera-differences-in-urp.html) | Understand how to use and configure cameras in URP.  
[Camera render types](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/camera-types-and-render-type.html) | Resources and techniques for the Base and Overlay camera types in URP.  
[Multiple cameras](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/cameras-multiple.html) | Set up and use more than one camera in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) to use in a camera stack, a split screen effect, or **post-processing** A process that improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PostProcessingOverview.html) post processing, postprocessing, postprocess  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#post-processing).  
[Camera render order](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/cameras-advanced.html) | Understand the order in which URP clears camera buffers and performs culling and rendering operations.  
[Motion vectors](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/features/motion-vectors-landing.html) | Resources for outputting and reading a texture with data about object motion in the camera view.  
[Upscaling resolution in URP with Spatial-Temporal Post-processing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/change-resolution-scale-urp.html) | Resources about using Spatial-Temporal Post-Processing (STP) to upscale resolution.  
[Access camera data with the Universal Additional Camera Data component in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/universal-additional-camera-data.html) | Use the Universal Additional Camera Data component to customise a cameraâ€™s behavior.  
[Camera Inspector windows reference for URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/camera-components-reference-landing.html) | Explore the properties in the Camera and Physical Camera component windows to customize cameras.  
## Additional properties
  * [Cameras](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Cameras.html)A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)
