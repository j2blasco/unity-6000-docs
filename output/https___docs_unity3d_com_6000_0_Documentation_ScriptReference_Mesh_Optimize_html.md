## Declaration
public void Optimize(); 
### Description
Optimizes the Mesh data to improve rendering performance.
This function causes the geometry and vertices of the mesh to be reordered internally in an attempt to improve vertex cache utilisation on the graphics hardware and thus rendering performance. This operation can take a few seconds or more for complex meshes and should only be used where the ordering of the geometry and vertices is not significant as both will change.  
  
You should only use this function on meshes you generate procedurally in code, for regular mesh assets it is called automatically by the import pipeline when 'Optimize Mesh' is enabled in the mesh importer settings.  
  
This function is effectively the same as calling [OptimizeIndexBuffers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.OptimizeIndexBuffers.html) followed by [OptimizeReorderVertexBuffer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.OptimizeReorderVertexBuffer.html) on the mesh.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Mesh[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.html) mesh = gameObject.GetComponent<MeshFilter[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MeshFilter.html)>().mesh;
        mesh.Optimize();
    }
}
