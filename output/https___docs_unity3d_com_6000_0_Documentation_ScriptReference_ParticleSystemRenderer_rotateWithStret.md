rotateWithStretchDirection; 
### Description
Rotate the particles based on the direction they are stretched in. This is added on top of other particle rotation.
This property only has effect when [freeformStretching](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemRenderer-freeformStretching.html) is enabled. When [freeformStretching](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemRenderer-freeformStretching.html) is disabled, particles are always rotated based on the direction they are stretched in, even if [rotateWithStretchDirection](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemRenderer-rotateWithStretchDirection.html) is false.
