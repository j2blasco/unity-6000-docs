### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
other | The other [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) involved in this collision.  
### Description
Called when a Collider with the [Collider.isTrigger](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider-isTrigger.html) property overlaps another Collider.
OnTriggerEnter is invoked when two GameObjects with a Collider component touch or overlap, and one of the Collider components has the [Collider.isTrigger](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider-isTrigger.html) property enabled. A trigger Collider doesn't register collisions with an incoming Rigidbody and doesn't collide with any other GameObjects that have Colliders on them. The events are invoked during simulation, which happens after all FixedUpdate methods are called, or within the scope of [Physics.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.Simulate.html), if you're using manual physics simulation.  
  
Any Collider on a GameObject that has a Rigidbody component, or on a child of a GameObject with a Rigidbody component can create OnTrigger events.  
  
To use the following code sample, create a primitive [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html), and attach a [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) and [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) component to it. Enable Collider.isTrigger and Rigidbody.isKinematic. This GameObject will travel forward, until it collides with another GameObject. When a collision occurs, the direction immediately reverses.

    //Moves this GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) 2 units a second in the forward direction

    }  
  
    //Upon collision with another GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html), this GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) will reverse direction
