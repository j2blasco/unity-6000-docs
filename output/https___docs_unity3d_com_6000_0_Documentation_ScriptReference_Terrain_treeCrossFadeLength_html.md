treeCrossFadeLength; 
### Description
Total distance delta that trees will use to transition from billboard orientation to mesh orientation.
Decreasing this value makes the transition happen faster. Setting it to 0 will produce a visible pop when switching from mesh to billboard representation.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Terrain.activeTerrain.treeCrossFadeLength = 20;
    }
