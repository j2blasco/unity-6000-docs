### Description
Add this attribute to a callback method to mark that this callback must be run after any callbacks that are part of the specified assembly.
To define dependencies for a callback, use the following attributes: 
  * [RunAfterClassAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Callbacks.RunAfterClassAttribute.html), [RunBeforeClassAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Callbacks.RunBeforeClassAttribute.html)
  * [RunAfterAssemblyAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Callbacks.RunAfterAssemblyAttribute.html), [RunBeforeAssemblyAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Callbacks.RunBeforeAssemblyAttribute.html)
  * [RunAfterPackageAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Callbacks.RunAfterPackageAttribute.html), [RunBeforePackageAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Callbacks.RunBeforePackageAttribute.html)


When the callback is invoked, Unity generates a dependency graph and uses topological sorting to ensure that all dependencies are run in sequence based on their dependencies. If callbacks dependencies are not present in the project then the instruction will be ignored during the generation of the dependency graph.  
  
**Note:** Defining callback dependencies is currently only supported by the [AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessAllAssets](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessAllAssets.html) callback.
```
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);
using UnityEditor.Callbacks;
using UnityEngine;  
  
// This example shows how to ensure that a callback is called after the Addressables assembly has been called.
class MyPostprocessor : AssetPostprocessor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.html)
{
    [RunAfterAssembly("Unity.Addressables.Editor")]
    static void OnPostprocessAllAssets(string[] importedAssets, string[] deletedAssets, string[] movedAssets, string[] movedFromAssetPaths)
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("MyPostprocessor");
    }
}

```
