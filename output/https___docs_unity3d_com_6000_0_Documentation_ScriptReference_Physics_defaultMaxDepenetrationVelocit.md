defaultMaxDepenetrationVelocity; 
### Description
The maximum default velocity needed to move a Rigidbody's collider out of another collider's surface penetration. Must be positive.
This value is usually changed in `Edit->Project Settings->Physics->Settings->Game Object` inspector instead of from scripts.  
  
**Note:** Very large values can introduce instability during collision detection; too small values might cause the collider depenetration to fail.  
  
You can also set a maximum depenetration velocity for individual Rigidbodies via [Rigidbody.maxDepenetrationVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-maxDepenetrationVelocity.html). 
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        // By default defaultMaxDepenetrationVelocity has a value of 10.0f
        Physics.defaultMaxDepenetrationVelocity[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics-defaultMaxDepenetrationVelocity.html) = 5.0f;
    }
}

```
