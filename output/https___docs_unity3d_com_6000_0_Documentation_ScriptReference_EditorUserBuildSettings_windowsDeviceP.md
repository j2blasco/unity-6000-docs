windowsDevicePortalUsername; 
### Description
Specifies the Windows DevicePortal username for the device to deploy and launch the UWP app on when using Build and Run.
This parameter is only necessary if WDP authentication is enabled on the target device, otherwise it can left empty.   
**Note:** This is _not_ the Windows logon user but a separate credential specific to DevicePortal. Please refer to the [Microsoft DevicePortal documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal) for more details.
