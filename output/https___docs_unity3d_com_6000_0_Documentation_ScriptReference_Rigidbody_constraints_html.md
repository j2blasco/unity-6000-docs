[RigidbodyConstraints](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyConstraints.html) constraints; 
### Description
Controls which degrees of freedom are allowed for the simulation of this Rigidbody.
By default this is set to [RigidbodyConstraints.None](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyConstraints.None.html), allowing rotation and movement along all axes. In some cases, you may want to constrain a [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) to only move or rotate along some axes, for example when developing 2D games. You can use the bitwise OR operator to combine multiple constraints.  
  
Note that position constraints are applied in World space, and rotation constraints are applied in the inertia space (relative to [Rigidbody.inertiaTensorRotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-inertiaTensorRotation.html)).
