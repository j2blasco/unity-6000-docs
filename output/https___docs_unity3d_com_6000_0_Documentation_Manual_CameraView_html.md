# The camera view
Resources about the view frustum, and techniques for changing or moving the **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene.

[Introduction to the camera view](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UnderstandingFrustum.html) | Learn about the shape of the region the camera views, including the view frustum and **clipping planes** A plane that limits how far or close a camera can see from its current position. A cameraâ€™s viewable range is between the far and near clipping planes. See far clipping plane and near clipping plane. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Camera.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#clippingplane).  
[Make the camera perspective oblique](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ObliqueFrustum.html) | Set the view frustum so that one side extends at a shallower angle, for example to increase the feeling of speed.  
[Calculate the size of the frustum at a distance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/FrustumSizeAtDistance.html) | Get the size and shape of the frustum rectangle at a distance from the camera.  
[CameraRays](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CameraRays.html) | Resources about calculating and using lines that point from the camera to positions in world space.
