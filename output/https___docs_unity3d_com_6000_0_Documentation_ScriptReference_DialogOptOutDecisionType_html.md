### Description
The type of opt-out decision a user can make.
This enum is used with [EditorUtility.DisplayDialog](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorUtility.DisplayDialog.html) and specifies the nature of the opt-out decision Unity presents to the user. It stores the user's decision on how long they would like to opt out for: either just for the current instance, or for all time on the computer they are currently using.
