# Finding your Asset Store packages
If you own a lot of packages from the **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore), it might be difficult to find what you need on the **My Assets** list. The Asset Store provides tools to help organize and find what you need.
To access the packages you purchased and downloaded from the Asset Store, click the **My Assets** link **(A)** or select **My Assets** from your profile drop-down menu **(B)**.
![Access My Assets from either the link or your profiles drop-down menu](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetPackagesOrganize.png) Access **My Assets** from either the link or your profile’s drop-down menu
The **My Assets** page lists the packages you purchased or downloaded from the Asset Store. The list matches any searches, filters, sorting, or categories you select.
![The My Assets page with labels \(A\), label management \(B\), search \(C\), Open in Unity \(D\), and search filters \(E\) highlighted.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetStoreMyAssets.png) The My Assets page with labels (A), label management (B), search (C), Open in Unity (D), and search filters (E) highlighted.
**(A)** [Labels](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetPackagesLabels.html) allow you to organize your packages from the Asset Store, like buckets that you put the assets into so you can find them again. You can also toggle between [hiding and showing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetPackagesOrganize.html#hide) your packages from the Asset Store.
**(B)** Click **Manage my labels** to go to edit mode, where you can apply changes to more than one package at a time.
**(C)** The search box lets you search for a package by entering a keyword. Keywords can include the package’s name, a word or phrase in its description, or a file name matching any files in the package.
**(D)** Click **Open in Unity** to load the Unity Hub so you can pick the project where you can add your package.
**(E)** The filter sidebar helps narrow down the list of packages displayed. You can apply these filters to any searches, categories, selections, or sorting schemes you make:
  * Choose one **Status** to remove any package that doesn’t match. For example, if you choose **Unlabeled** , then only those packages that you never assigned a label to appear in the list.
  * Choose any of the **Labels** that you [applied to your Asset Store packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetPackagesLabels.html) before. You can search for a label name, if the list is long. If you select more than one label, then only those packages that match any one label remain in the list.
  * Choose any of the categories and subcategories to keep all packages from the Asset Store that match any selection.
  * Search for a publisher by name.


## Hiding packages from the My Assets list
You can mark packages as hidden in your **My Assets** list on the Unity Asset Store. For example, if you no longer need a deprecated package, hiding it from your list in the Asset Store or the Package Manager window can reduce the clutter. Because you can’t remove Asset Store packages from your account, this is the equivalent of deleting the package from your account.
To hide your asset, under the **Release Notes** for your assets, click **Hide asset**.
![The Hide asset link and the Hidden Assets status checkbox in the My Assets list on the Asset Store](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetPackage-hide.png) The **Hide asset** link and the **Hidden Assets** status checkbox in the **My Assets** list on the Asset Store
If you need to access them again, you can always select the **Hidden Assets** status from the filter sidebar.
![Remove the Hidden asset marker to display the package in the My Assets list again](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetPackage-show.png) Remove the **Hidden asset** marker to display the package in the **My Assets** list again
To stop hiding a package from the Asset Store, you can click the **x** on the **Hidden asset** marker.
To hide several assets at once:
  1. Click **Manage my labels** to display checkboxes next to each package in the **My Assets** list. A set of group links also appear at the top.
![In edit mode, checkboxes appear beside each package and links that apply to all selected packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetPackage-masslabel.png) In edit mode, checkboxes appear beside each package and links that apply to all selected packages
  2. Enable **Select all** to select all packages at once or click the checkbox beside each package you want to include.
  3. Click **Hide asset** to mark the selected packages as hidden.
The hidden packages disappear from the **My Assets** list.
  4. To exit the edit mode, click **Done**.
