## Declaration
public static float SmoothDampAngle(float current, float target, ref float currentVelocity, float smoothTime, float maxSpeed = Mathf.Infinity, float deltaTime = Time.deltaTime); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
current | The current position.  
target | The target position.  
currentVelocity | The current velocity. This method modifies the currentVelocity every time the method is called.  
smoothTime | The approximate time it takes to reach the target position. The lower the value the faster this method reaches the target. The minimum value is 0.0001. If a lower value is specified, it is automatically clamped to this minimum value.  
maxSpeed | Use this optional parameter to specify a maximum speed. By default, the maximum speed is set to infinity.  
deltaTime | The time since this method was last called. By default, this is set to `Time.deltaTime`.  
### Description
Gradually changes an angle given in degrees towards a desired goal angle over time.
This method smoothes the value with a spring-damper like algorithm that never overshoots the target value. This algorithm is based on Game Programming Gems 4, Chapter 1.10.  
  
**Note:** This method attempts to avoid overshooting the target value. When deltaTime is 0.0f, this yields NaN for the currentVelocity. If you call back with a currentVelocity of NaN, this method returns a NaN.

        Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) position = target.position;
        // Then offset by distance behind the new angle
