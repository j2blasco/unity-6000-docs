frameCount; 
### Description
The total number of frames since the start of the game (Read Only).
This value starts at 0 and increases by 1 on each [Update](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html) phase.  
  
Internally, Unity uses a 64 bit integer which it downcasts to 32 bits when this is called, and discards the most significant (i.e. top) 32 bits.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Makes sure that RecalculateValue only performs
    // some operations once per frame and no more.
    static private int lastRecalculation = -1;  
  
    static void RecalculateValue()
    {
        if (lastRecalculation == Time.frameCount[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-frameCount.html))
            return;
        //  ProcessData.AndDoSomeCalculations();
    }
}

```

**Note:** frameCount starts once all Awake functions have finished. The frameCount value is undefined during Awake functions.
