[RenderTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html) active; 
### Description
Currently active render texture.
All rendering goes into the active RenderTexture. If the active RenderTexture is `null` everything is rendered in the main window.  
  
Setting [RenderTexture.active](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-active.html) is the same as calling [Graphics.SetRenderTarget](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.SetRenderTarget.html). Typically you change or query the active render texture when implementing custom graphics effects; if all you need is to make a Camera render into a texture then use [Camera.targetTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-targetTexture.html) instead.  
  
When a RenderTexture becomes active its hardware rendering context is automatically created if it hasn't been created already.
