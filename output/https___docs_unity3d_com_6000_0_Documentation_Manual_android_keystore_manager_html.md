# Keystore Manager window reference
This page describes the Keystore Manager window interface.
To open the Keystore Manager window, open [Android Publishing Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsAndroid.html#Publishing) and select **Keystore Manager**.
You can use this interface to:
  * [Create a new keystore](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/android-keystore-create.html)
  * [Add keys to a keystore](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/android-keystore-add-keys.html)
  * [Load an existing keystore](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/android-keystore-load.html)


## Keystore
The properties in this section of the interface relate to the keystore that the Keystore Manager window currently manages.
**Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Keystore dropdown** | Specifies which keystore to use in the Keystore Manager window. You can either create a new keystore, or load an existing one. For more information, refer to:
  * [Create a new keystore](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/android-keystore-create.html)
  * [Load an existing keystore](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/android-keystore-load.html)

  
**Password** | The password for the keystore. If you create a new keystore, use this to create a password for the keystore. If you load an existing keystore, use this to enter the password for existing keystore. This property supports ASCII characters only.  
**Confirm Password** | The confirmed password for the new keystore. Set the value of this property to the same as **Password**.  
  
This property only appears if you create a new keystore.  
## Existing Keys
This section of the interface contains a read-only list of keys that the current keystore contains.
## New Key Values
The properties in this section of the interface describe a new key to add to the keystore. For more information, see [Add keys to a keystore](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/android-keystore-add-keys.html).
