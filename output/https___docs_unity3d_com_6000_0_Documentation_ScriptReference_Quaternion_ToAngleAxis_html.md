## Declaration
public void ToAngleAxis(out float angle, out [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) axis); 
### Description
Converts a rotation to angle-axis representation (angles in degrees).
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Extracts the angle - axis rotation from the transform rotation  
  
        float angle = 0.0f;
        Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) axis = Vector3.zero[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-zero.html);
        transform.rotation.ToAngleAxis(out angle, out axis);
    }
}
