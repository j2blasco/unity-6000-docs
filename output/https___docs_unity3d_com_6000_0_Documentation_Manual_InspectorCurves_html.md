# Use curves
A curve is a line graph that shows the response (on the y-axis) to the value of an input (on the x-axis) as that input changes. The Unity Editor uses curves in many components. For more information about using curves, refer to [Edit Animation curves](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/EditingCurves.html).
## Save curve presets and create libraries
You can save your current curve as a preset, and organize presets into libraries.
### Save a curve preset
To save your current curve as a preset:
  1. In the **Curve Editor** , click the **Settings** button. The **Presets** panel opens.
  2. The last curve in the list is a representation of your current edit. Click it to save the curve as a preset.


### Delete or replace a curve preset
To delete a preset, in the **Presets** panel, right-click the preset and select **Delete**. 
To replace a preset, in the **Presets** panel, right-click the preset and select **Replace**. This action saves your current curve to the preset.
### Create and manage curve libraries
You can save your curve presets to one or more libraries, and move between your library and the default library. Use the **More** (⋮) menu to create and move between libraries.
**Tip:** To add the built-in curves to your library, from the **Preset** panel’s **More** (⋮) menu, select **Add Factory Presets To Current Library**.
