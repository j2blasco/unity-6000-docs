tag; 
### Description
The tag assigned to the GameObject.
A tag can be used to identify a GameObject. Tags must be declared in the [Tags and Layers manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-TagManager.html) before using them.  
  
**Note:** Do not set a tag from [Awake()](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html) or [OnValidate()](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnValidate.html). The order in which `Awake` is called is not deterministic between components and a tag can be overwritten when its `Awake` is called. If you do this, Unity generates the warning `SendMessage cannot be called during Awake, CheckConsistency, or OnValidate`.  
  
The example below sets the current GameObject's tag to "Player" and then implements [MonoBehaviour.OnTriggerEnter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnTriggerEnter.html) to check if the [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) on the other object involved in a collision with this object is tagged "Enemy".
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        //Set the tag of this GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) to Player
        gameObject.tag = "Player";
    }  
  
    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) other)
    {
        //Check if the collider of the other GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) involved in the collision is tagged "Enemy"
        if (other.tag == "Enemy")
        {
            Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Triggered by Enemy");
        }
    }
}

```
