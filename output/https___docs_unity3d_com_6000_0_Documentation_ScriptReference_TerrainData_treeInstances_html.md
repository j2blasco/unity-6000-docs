treeInstances; 
### Description
Contains the current trees placed in the terrain.
Note that setting the treeInstances property will not automatically snap Tree instances onto the surface of the Terrain heightmap. To do so, use [SetTreeInstances](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TerrainData.SetTreeInstances.html) instead.
