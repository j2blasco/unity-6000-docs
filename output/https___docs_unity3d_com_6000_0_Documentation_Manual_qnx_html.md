# QNX
QNX is a commercial and real-time operating system much like a Unix-like operating system. Use this section to familiarize yourself with setting up the Unity Editor to run on devices that use QNX. For more information about the QNX platform, refer to [QNX product documentation](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/index.html).
**Note:** The Unity Editor for Embedded Platforms is available under separate terms. For download information and licensing, contact your Account Manager or the [Unity Sales](https://create.unity.com/unity-for-industries) team.
