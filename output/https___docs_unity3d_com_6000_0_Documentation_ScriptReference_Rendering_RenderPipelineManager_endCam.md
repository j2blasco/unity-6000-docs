### Description
Delegate that you can use to invoke custom code after Unity renders an individual Camera.
When Unity calls [RenderPipeline.EndCameraRendering](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipeline.EndCameraRendering.html), it executes the methods in this delegate's invocation list.  
  
In the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), Unity calls [RenderPipeline.EndCameraRendering](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipeline.EndCameraRendering.html) automatically. If you are writing a custom Scriptable Render Pipeline and you want to use this delegate, you must add a call to [RenderPipeline.EndCameraRendering](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipeline.EndCameraRendering.html).  
  
The following code example demonstrates how to add a method to this delegate's invocation list, and later remove it.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        RenderPipelineManager.endCameraRendering[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-endCameraRendering.html) += OnEndCameraRendering;
    }  
  
    void OnEndCameraRendering(ScriptableRenderContext[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.html) context, Camera[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) camera)
    {
        // Put the code that you want to execute after the camera renders here
        // If you are using URP or HDRP, Unity calls this method automatically
        // If you are writing a custom SRP, you must call RenderPipeline.EndCameraRendering[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipeline.EndCameraRendering.html)
    }  
  
    void OnDestroy()
    {
        RenderPipelineManager.endCameraRendering[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-endCameraRendering.html) -= OnEndCameraRendering;
    }
}

```
