CommandBuffer fundamentals in the Built-In Render Pipeline
# Custom rendering in the Built-In Render Pipeline
Resources for using the `CommandBuffer` API to schedule and execute rendering commands at various points in the Built-in **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline). This allows you to customize and extend Unityâ€™s rendering functionality

[Command buffer fundamentals](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GraphicsCommandBuffers.html) | Understand how a `CommandBuffer` object holds a list of rendering commands that you can schedule and execute at various points in the Built-in Render Pipeline.  
[CameraEvent and LightEvent events order reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GraphicsCommandBuffers-order.html) | Explore the **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) and light events you can use to schedule rendering commands at a specific time.
