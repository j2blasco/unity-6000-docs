### Description
Specifies the new raster state.
Unity applies these values to the GPU's render state if [RenderStateBlock.mask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderStateBlock-mask.html) includes a value of [RenderStateMask.Raster](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderStateMask.Raster.html).  
  
The default value is [RasterState.defaultValue](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RasterState-defaultValue.html).
