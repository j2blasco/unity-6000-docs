### Description
Stores a set of information that describes the bind pose of this Sprite.
This struct describes the hierarchy and other spatial relationships between the bones of this Sprite.
### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[color](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/U2D.SpriteBone-color.html) | Shows the color set for the bone in the Editor.  
[guid](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/U2D.SpriteBone-guid.html) | The Unique GUID of this bone.  
[length](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/U2D.SpriteBone-length.html) | The length of the bone. This is important for the leaf bones to describe their length without needing another bone as the terminal bone.  
[name](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/U2D.SpriteBone-name.html) | The name of the bone. This is useful when recreating bone hierarchy at editor or runtime. You can also use this as a way of resolving the bone path when a Sprite is bound to a more complex or richer hierarchy.  
[parentId](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/U2D.SpriteBone-parentId.html) | The ID of the parent of this bone.  
[position](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/U2D.SpriteBone-position.html) | The position in local space of this bone.  
[rotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/U2D.SpriteBone-rotation.html) | The rotation of this bone in local space.
