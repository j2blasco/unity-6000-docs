RoslynAnalyzerDllPaths; 
### Description
Stores the paths to the .dll files.
RoslynAnalyzerDllPaths contain either relative or absolute paths, for example C:\MyUnityProject\Assets\MyRoslynAnalyzer.dll, or Assets\MyRoslynAnalyzer.dll. Your Unity project is compiled with these Roslyn analyzers. To use Roslyn analyzers in a Unity project, save the analyzer .dll files inside the Assets folder (or any of its nested folders), and give them the label RoslynAnalyzer.
