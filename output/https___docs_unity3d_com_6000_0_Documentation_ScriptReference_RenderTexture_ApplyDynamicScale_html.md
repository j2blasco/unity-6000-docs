### Description
Applies the [Dynamic Resolution system](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/DynamicResolution.html) scale.
If a render texture has the [useDynamicScaleExplicit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-useDynamicScaleExplicit.html) flag set, then the dynamic resolution scale is applied. Otherwise, the call is ignored.
