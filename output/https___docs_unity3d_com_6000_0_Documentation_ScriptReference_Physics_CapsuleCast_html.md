## Declaration
public static bool CapsuleCast([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) point1, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) point2, float radius, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) direction, float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers, [QueryTriggerInteraction](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QueryTriggerInteraction.html) queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
point1 | The center of the sphere at the `start` of the capsule.  
point2 | The center of the sphere at the `end` of the capsule.  
radius | The radius of the capsule.  
direction | The direction into which to sweep the capsule.  
maxDistance | The max length of the sweep.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a capsule.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
### Returns
**bool** True when the capsule sweep intersects any collider, otherwise false. 
### Description
Casts a capsule against all colliders in the Scene and returns detailed information on what was hit.
The capsule is defined by the two spheres with `radius` around `point1` and `point2`, which form the two ends of the capsule. Hits are returned for the first collider which would collide against this capsule if the capsule was moved along `direction`. This is useful when a Raycast does not give enough precision, because you want to find out if an object of a specific size, such as a character, will be able to move somewhere without colliding with anything on the way.  
  
**Notes:** CapsuleCast will not detect colliders for which the capsule overlaps the collider. Passing a zero radius results in undefined output and doesn't always behave the same as [Physics.Raycast](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html).
