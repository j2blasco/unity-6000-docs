# Creating your Publisher Account
Before you can create package drafts and upload Assets to them, you need to set up a Publisher Account:
  1. If you do not yet have a Unity Account, you need to create one; to do this, go to [Create a Unity ID](https://id.unity.com/account/new). Alternatively, open the Unity **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore), click **Sign In** and then select **Create a Unity Account** :
![When you click Sign In, the Unity ID login appears with another link to Create a Unity Account.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetStoreCreateUnityID.png) When you click **Sign In** , the Unity ID login appears with another link to **Create a Unity Account**.
  2. Carefully read the [Asset Store Provider Agreement](https://unity3d.com/legal/as_provider) for legal information, and the [Submission Guidelines](https://unity3d.com/asset-store/sell-assets/submission-guidelines) to learn about the submission process.
  3. Open the [Create New Asset Store Publisher](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/create.html) page and provide the required [Profile](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#Profile) information:
![Profile section](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetStoreCreateAcct-Profile.png) Profile section
**(A)** [Profile picture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#ProfilePicture) where you can upload your logo or brand image
**(B)** [Publisher name](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#ProfilePublisherName) where you can specify the account name
**(C)** [Website](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#ProfileWebsite) where you can set your website’s location
**(D)** [Customer Support](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#ProfileCustomerSupport) where you can set the location for support
  4. Provide the required [Promo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#Promo) information:
![Promo section: A-Promo media, B-Promo paragraph](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetStoreCreateAcct-Promo.png) Promo section: A-Promo media, B-Promo paragraph
  5. Optionally, you can also provide information in the [About](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#About), [Social Media](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#Social), and [Google Analytics](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#Google) sections:
![Optional sections: A-About, B-Social links, C-Google Analytics](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AssetStoreCreateAcct-Optional.png) Optional sections: A-About, B-Social links, C-Google Analytics
**Note** : You can add and modify the optional information at any time; to do this, return to your Publisher Account page and navigate to the **Info** tab.
  6. Click the **Save and Preview** button at the bottom of the screen.
The **Asset Store Provider Agreement** dialog box asks you to confirm.
  7. Enable **Accept Terms of Service** and click **OK** to finalize creating your Asset Store Publisher Account.
  8. A dialog box appears to inform you that Unity has successfully created your Publisher Profile. Click **OK** and return to the Editor to complete the publication process.
Your new customer-facing Publisher Account page now appears in the Unity Asset Store.


**Note** : The information you provide appears on the Asset Store on your customer-facing Publisher Account page, with a few exceptions where indicated. You can see Unity’s own [Publisher’s Account page](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/1) for an example of a customer-facing Publisher Account page.
