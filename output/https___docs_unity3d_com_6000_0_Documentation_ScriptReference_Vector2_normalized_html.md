[Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) normalized; 
### Description
Returns a normalized vector based on the current vector. The normalized vector has a [magnitude](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-magnitude.html) of 1 and is in the same direction as the current vector. Returns a zero vector If the current vector is too small to be normalized.
Note that this does not modify the current vector. To modify and normalize the current vector, use the [Normalize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.Normalize.html) function.
