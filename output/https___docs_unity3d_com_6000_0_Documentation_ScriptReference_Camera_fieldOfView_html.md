fieldOfView; 
### Description
The vertical field of view of the Camera, in degrees.
This is the vertical field of view; horizontal field of view depends on the viewport's aspect ratio. For for more information, see [VerticalToHorizontalFieldOfView](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.VerticalToHorizontalFieldOfView.html).  
  
If [Camera.orthographic](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-orthographic.html) is `true`, the Camera ignores `fieldOfView`.  
  
Some VR SDKs have fixed field of view values that are used for VR cameras. When VR is enabled with those SDKs, this property will always return the value from the SDK. You will see a warning logged if you attempt to set the property and the value will be ignored.  
  
If you make changes to [Camera.projectionMatrix](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-projectionMatrix.html), the Camera ignores `fieldOfView`. This lasts until you call [Camera.ResetProjectionMatrix](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.ResetProjectionMatrix.html).  
  
In the Unity Editor, this corresponds to the **Clipping Planes: Near** property in the Camera component Inspector.
