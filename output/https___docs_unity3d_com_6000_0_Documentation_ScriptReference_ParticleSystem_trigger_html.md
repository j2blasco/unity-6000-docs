[ParticleSystem.TriggerModule](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.TriggerModule.html) trigger; 
### Description
Script interface for the TriggerModule of a Particle System.
This module is useful for killing particles when they touch a set of collision shapes, or for calling a script command to let you apply custom particle behaviors when the trigger is activated.  
  
The example code for [MonoBehaviour.OnParticleTrigger](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnParticleTrigger.html) shows how the callback type action works.  
  
Particle System modules do not need to be reassigned back to the system; they are interfaces and not independent objects.
