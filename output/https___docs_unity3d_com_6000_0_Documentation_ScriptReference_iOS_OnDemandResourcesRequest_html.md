### Description
Represents a request for On Demand Resources (ODR). It's an [AsyncOperation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AsyncOperation.html) and can be yielded in a coroutine.
**NOTE:** only available on iOS.  
  
Creating an [OnDemandResourcesRequest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/iOS.OnDemandResourcesRequest.html) is equivalent to calling [ NSBundleResourceRequest.beginAccessingResourcesWithCompletionHandler ](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsbundleresourcerequest/1614840-beginaccessingresources). The request will keep the on demand resource alive until either [Dispose](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/iOS.OnDemandResourcesRequest.Dispose.html)() is called or the request object is collected by a garbage collector, which is the equivalent of calling [NSBundleResourceRequest.endAccessingResources ](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsbundleresourcerequest/1614843-endaccessingresources).

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.iOS;
using System[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.VirtualTexturing.System.html);
using System.Collections;  
  
public static class Loader
{
    public static IEnumerator LoadAsset(string resourceName)
    {
        // Create the request
        var request = OnDemandResources.PreloadAsync[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/iOS.OnDemandResources.PreloadAsync.html)(new string[] { "Asset[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/VersionControl.Asset.html)'s ODR tag" });  
  
        // Wait until request is completed
        yield return request;  
  
        // Check for errors
        if (request.error != null)
            throw new Exception("ODR request failed: " + request.error);  
  
        // Get path to the resource and use it
        var path = request.GetResourcePath(resourceName);
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)(path);  
  
        // Call Dispose() when resource is no longer needed.
        request.Dispose();
    }
}
