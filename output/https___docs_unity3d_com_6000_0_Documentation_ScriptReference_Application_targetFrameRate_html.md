targetFrameRate; 
### Description
Specifies the target frame rate at which Unity tries to render your game.
An integer > 0, or special value -1 (default).  
  
**Desktop and Web** : If [QualitySettings.vSyncCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QualitySettings-vSyncCount.html) is set to 0, then `Application.targetFrameRate` chooses a target frame rate for the game. If `vSyncCount != 0`, then `targetFrameRate` is ignored.  
  
**Android and iOS** : Mobile platforms always ignore [QualitySettings.vSyncCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QualitySettings-vSyncCount.html) and instead use `Application.targetFrameRate` to choose a target frame rate for the game. Use `targetFrameRate` to control the frame rate of your game. This is useful for capping your game's frame rate to make sure your game displays smoothly and consistently under heavy rendering workloads. You can also reduce your game's frame rate to conserve battery life and avoid overheating on mobile devices.  
  
When `QualitySettings.vSyncCount = 0` and `Application.targetFrameRate = -1`:  
  
- **Desktop** : Content is rendered unsynchronized as fast as possible.  
  
- **Web** : Content is rendered at the native display refresh rate.  
  
- **Android and iOS** : Content is rendered at **fixed 30 fps** to conserve battery power, independent of the native refresh rate of the display.  
  
**Desktop and Web** : It is recommended to use `QualitySettings.vSyncCount` over `Application.targetFrameRate` because `vSyncCount` implements a hardware-based synchronization mechanism, whereas `targetFrameRate`, which is a software-based timing method is subject to microstuttering. In other words, on Desktop and Web platforms, setting `vSyncCount = 0` and using `targetFrameRate` will not produce a completely stutter-free output. Always use `vSyncCount > 0` when smooth frame pacing is needed.  
  
**Web, Android and iOS** : Rendering is always limited by the maximum refresh rate of the display. Setting `vSyncCount = 0` and `targetFrameRate` to an arbitrary high value will not exceed the display's native refresh rate, even if the rendering workload is sufficiently low.  
  
**Android and iOS** : To render at the native refresh rate of the display, set `Application.targetFrameRate` to the value from the [Resolution.refreshRateRatio](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Resolution-refreshRateRatio.html) field of the [Screen.currentResolution](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Screen-currentResolution.html) property.  
  
**iOS** : The native refresh rate of the display is controlled by the Apple **ProMotion** feature. When ProMotion is disabled in the project (default for new projects), the native refresh rate is 60 Hz. When ProMotion is enabled, the native refresh rate is 120 Hz on the iOS displays that support ProMotion, 60 Hz otherwise.  
  
**Android and iOS** : If the specified rate does not evenly divide the current refresh rate of the display, then the value of `Application.targetFrameRate` is rounded down to the nearest number that does. For example, when running on a 60Hz Android display, and `Application.targetFrameRate = 25`, then content is effectively rendered at 20fps, since 20 is the highest number below 25 that divides 60 evenly.  
  
**VR platforms**  
  
VR platforms ignore both [QualitySettings.vSyncCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QualitySettings-vSyncCount.html) and `Application.targetFrameRate` and instead, the VR SDK controls the frame rate.  
  
**Unity Editor**  
  
In the Editor, `Application.targetFrameRate` affects only the Game view. It has no effect on other Editor windows.
