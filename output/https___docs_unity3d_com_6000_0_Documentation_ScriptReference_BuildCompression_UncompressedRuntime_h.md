### Description
Uncompressed Asset Bundle.
Uncompressed Asset Bundles are large, but are the fastest to access once downloaded. Uncompressed bundles are 16-byte aligned.  
  
This BuildCompression is only supported for recompressing Asset Bundles at runtime and is not available for building Asset Bundles. Use Uncompressed for building Asset Bundles.
