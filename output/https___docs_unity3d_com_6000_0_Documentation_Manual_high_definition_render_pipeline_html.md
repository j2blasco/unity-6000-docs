Using the Built-In Render Pipeline
# Using the High Definition Render Pipeline
The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) is a prebuilt [Scriptable Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scriptable-render-pipeline-introduction.html), built by Unity. HDRP lets you create cutting-edge, high-fidelity graphics for high-end platforms.
![A scene from Time Ghost, a real-time HDRP cinematic created with Unity 6. A figure stands with their back to the camera, against a vast open field with a mountain range in the far distance.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/hdrp-time-ghost.jpg) A scene from [Time Ghost](https://unity.com/demos/time-ghost), a real-time HDRP cinematic created with Unity 6. A figure stands with their back to the camera, against a vast open field with a mountain range in the far distance.
Use HDRP for AAA quality games, automotive demos, architectural applications and anything that requires high-fidelity graphics. HDRP uses physically-based lighting and materials, and supports both forward and deferred rendering. HDRP uses compute **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) technology and therefore requires compatible GPU hardware.
For information on how to use HDRP, see the [HDRP documentation microsite](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest).
