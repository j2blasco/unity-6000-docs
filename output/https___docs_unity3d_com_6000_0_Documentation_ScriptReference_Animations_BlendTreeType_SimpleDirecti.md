### Description
Best used when your motions represent different directions, such as "walk forward", "walk backward", "walk left", and "walk right", or "aim up", "aim down", "aim left", and "aim right".
Optionally a single motion at position (0, 0) can be included, such as "idle" or "aim straight". In the Simple Directional type there should not be multiple motions in the same direction, such as "walk forward" and "run forward".
