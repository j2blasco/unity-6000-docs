[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) inertiaTensor; 
### Description
The inertia tensor of this body, defined as a diagonal matrix in a reference frame positioned at this body's center of mass and rotated by [Rigidbody.inertiaTensorRotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-inertiaTensorRotation.html).
Inertia tensor is a rotational analog of mass: the larger the inertia component about a particular axis is, the more torque that is required to achieve the same angular acceleration about that axis.  
  
Zero is not a valid inertia tensor component. Therefore, the physics system interprets zeros as infinite values instead. So, for example, a body with (0, 1, 1) inertia tensor is impossible to rotate around X.  
  
Note that the rotational Constraints [RigidbodyConstraints](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyConstraints.html) of Rigidbody are actually implemented by setting the inertia tensor components about the locked degrees of freedom to zero.  
  
If you don't set the inertia tensor from a script, it is calculated automatically from all colliders attached to the Rigidbody. To reset the inertia tensor to the automatically computed value, call [Rigidbody.ResetInertiaTensor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.ResetInertiaTensor.html).
```

// the inspector.

public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) tensor;
    public Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) rb;
    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)>();
        rb.inertiaTensor = tensor;
    }
}
