## Declaration
public void Simulate(float step); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
step | The time to advance physics by.  
### Returns
**void** Whether the simulation was run or not. Running the simulation during physics callbacks will always fail. 
### Description
Simulate physics associated with this [PhysicsScene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene.html).
Calling this method causes the physics to be simulated over the specified `step` time. Only the physics associated with this [PhysicsScene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene.html) will be simulated. If this [PhysicsScene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene.html) is not the default physics Scene (see [Physics.defaultPhysicsScene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics-defaultPhysicsScene.html)) then it is associated with a specific [Scene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.Scene.html) and as such, only components added to that [Scene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.Scene.html) are affected when running the simulation.  
  
If you pass framerate-dependent step values (such as [Time.deltaTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html)) to the physics engine, your simulation will be less deterministic because of the unpredictable fluctuations in framerate that can arise. To achieve more deterministic physics results, you should pass a fixed step value to [PhysicsScene.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene.Simulate.html) every time you call it.  
  
You can call [PhysicsScene.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene.Simulate.html) in the Editor outside of play mode however caution is advised as this will cause the simulation to move GameObject that have a [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) component attached. When simulating in the Editor outside of play mode, a full simulation occurs for all physics components including [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html), [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) and [Joint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint.html) including the generation of contacts however contacts are not reported via the standard script callbacks. This is a safety measure to prevent allowing callbacks to delete objects in the Scene which would not be an undoable operation. Here is an example of a basic simulation that implements what's being done in the automatic simulation mode.
