Texture and mesh loading
# Loading texture and mesh data asynchronously
Strategies and resources for uploading texture and **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Mesh) data to the GPU asynchronously, to improve performance.
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Uploading texture and mesh data to the GPU](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LoadingTextureandMeshData.html) | Understand the difference between the synchronous and asynchronous upload pipelines, and what makes a mesh eligible for asynchronous upload.  
[Check whether a mesh uses the asynchronous upload pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/identify-mesh-upload-pipeline.html) | Identify whether Unity is using the synchronous or asynchronous upload pipeline for a specific mesh.  
[Configure the asynchronous upload pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/configure-asynchronous-upload-pipeline.html) | Configure the streaming buffer and upload time Unity allocates for asynchronously uploading mesh data to the GPU.
