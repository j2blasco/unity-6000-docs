[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) position; 
### Description
The position of the particle.
The position is defined relative to the simulation space (ie, world space or local space) set by the simulationSpace property. You can use [Transform.TransformPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.TransformPoint.html) and [Transform.InverseTransformPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.InverseTransformPoint.html) to convert points between local and world space as necessary.
