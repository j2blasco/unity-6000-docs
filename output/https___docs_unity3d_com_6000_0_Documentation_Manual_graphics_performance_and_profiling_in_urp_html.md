# Graphics performance and profiling in URP
Resources for understanding and improving rendering performance in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).
**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Understand performance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/understand-performance.html) | Understand how the performance of your project depends on the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) features you use or enable, what your **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) contain, and which platforms you target.   
[Analyze your project](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/analyze-your-project.html) | Analyze the performance of your project with tools such as the Unity **Profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Profiler) or a GPU profiler.  
[Reducing rendering work on the CPU or GPU](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/OptimizingGraphicsPerformance-urp.html) | Resources for reducing rendering work on the CPU, or adjusting settings to improve performance.  
[Optimizing draw calls](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/reduce-draw-calls-landing-urp.html) | Techniques for speeding up rendering by reducing the number of drawing commands the CPU sends to the GPU.  
[Rendering Debugger](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/features/rendering-debugger.html) | Resources for using the Rendering Debugger window to check lighting, rendering, and Material properties, and identify rendering issues.
