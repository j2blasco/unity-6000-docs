solverVelocityIterations; 
### Description
The solverVelocityIterations affects how how accurately Rigidbody joints and collision contacts are resolved. Overrides [Physics.defaultSolverVelocityIterations](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics-defaultSolverVelocityIterations.html). Must be positive.
Increasing this value will result in higher accuracy of the resulting exit velocity after a Rigidbody bounce. If you are experiencing issues with jointed Rigidbodies or Ragdolls moving too much after collisions you can try to increase this value.
