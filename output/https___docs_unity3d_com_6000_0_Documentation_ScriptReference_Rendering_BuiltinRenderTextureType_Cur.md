Currently active render target.
During command buffer execution, this identifies the render target that is active "right now". During command buffer execution, the active render target might be changed by [CommandBuffer.SetRenderTarget](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CommandBuffer.SetRenderTarget.html) or [CommandBuffer.Blit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CommandBuffer.Blit.html) commands.
