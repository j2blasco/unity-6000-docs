### Description
Signifies that value of this property contains the main texture of the Material.
This flag corresponds to the `[MainTexture]` [ShaderLab Properties attribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SL-Properties.html).  
  
By default, Unity considers a texture with the property name name `"_MainTex"` to be the main texture. Use the `[MainTexture]` ShaderLab Properties attribute to make Unity consider a texture with a different property name to be the main texture.
