### Description
A set of options for the level of compression the Editor uses for lightmaps.
### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[None](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightmapCompression.None.html) | Does not compress lightmaps.  
[LowQuality](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightmapCompression.LowQuality.html) | Compresses lightmaps in a low-quality format. This may use less memory and storage than Normal Quality, but can also introduce visual artifacts.  
[NormalQuality](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightmapCompression.NormalQuality.html) | Compresses lightmaps in a medium-quality format. Provides better visual results better than Low Quality but not as good as High Quality. This is a good trade-off between memory usage and visual quality.  
[HighQuality](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightmapCompression.HighQuality.html) | Compresses lightmaps in a high-quality format. Requires more memory and storage than Normal Quality, but provides better visual results.
