### Description
Delegate that you can use to invoke custom code right before [RenderPipelineManager.currentPipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-currentPipeline.html) is disposed.
Whenever you switch [GraphicsSettings.currentRenderPipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.GraphicsSettings-currentRenderPipeline.html) or [QualitySettings.renderPipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QualitySettings-renderPipeline.html), Unity will dispose the current `RenderPipeline` before instantiate the new `RenderPipeline`. You can subscribe to this event to know when current `RenderPipeline` will be disposed. To access the currently disposing `RenderPipeline` object you can rely on [RenderPipelineManager.currentPipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-currentPipeline.html).
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
  
public class CurrentRenderPipelineDisposedExample : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        RenderPipelineManager.activeRenderPipelineDisposed[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-activeRenderPipelineDisposed.html) += RenderPipelineManager_activeRenderPipelineDisposed;
    }  
  
    private void OnDestroy()
    {
        RenderPipelineManager.activeRenderPipelineDisposed[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-activeRenderPipelineDisposed.html) -= RenderPipelineManager_activeRenderPipelineDisposed;
    }  
  
    private void RenderPipelineManager_activeRenderPipelineDisposed()
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)($"Render Pipeline {RenderPipelineManager.currentPipeline.GetType().Name} is disposing.");
    }
}
