Introduction to dynamic batching
# Batching moving GameObjects
Resources for combining moving **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) into fewer draw calls.

[Introduction to dynamic batching](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/dynamic-batching.html) | Understand how Unity combines dynamic GameObjects, and its limitations.  
[How Unity batches moving GameObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/dynamic-batching-meshes.html) | Learn how Unity combines meshes and dynamic meshes into a single draw call.  
[Enable dynamic batching](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/dynamic-batching-enable.html) | Enable Unity performing **static batching** A technique Unity uses to draw GameObjects on the screen that combines static (non-moving) GameObjects into big Meshes, and renders them in a faster way.
