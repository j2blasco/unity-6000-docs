### Description
Deferred Shading.
This is a standard deferred shading path, that renders Scene information into G-Buffers using multiple render targets, and computes lighting afterwards.  
  
Due to use of multiple render targets, it requires GPU with MRT support.  
  
Note: Deferred rendering is not compatible with orthographic camera projection.
