# Sprite shape renderer
The ****Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) Shape Renderer** component renders the geometry that Unity generates along a [Spline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.splines@latest) and controls how it visually appears in a **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) for both [2D and 3D projects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2Dor3D.html). Its inputs are derived from the [Sprite Shape Profile](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.spriteshape@latest).
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[**Color**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/shape-renderer/color.html) | Change the color and the transparency of the sprite.  
[**Mask Interaction**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/shape-renderer/mask-interaction.html) | Choose whether the sprite is visible inside or outside a **Sprite Mask** A texture which defines which areas of an underlying image to reveal or hide. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/mask/mask-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SpriteMask).  
[**Sprite shape renderer reference**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/shape-renderer/sprite-shape-renderer-reference.html) | Control the appearance and rendering priority of the Sprite Shape in relation to other elements and Sprite Masks.
