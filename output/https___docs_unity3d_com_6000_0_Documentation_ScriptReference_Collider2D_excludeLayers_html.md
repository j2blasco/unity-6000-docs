[LayerMask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LayerMask.html) excludeLayers; 
### Description
The additional Layers that this [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) should exclude when deciding if a contact with another [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) should happen or not.
The Layer Collision Matrix defines which Layers can and cannot contact other Layers. This property allows you to exclude Layers that this specific [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) instance should not contact.  
  
When excluding Layers, all Layers that should be included are first included before finally excluding Layers. In other words, both including and excluding a Layer results in the Layer always being excluded.  
  
**NOTE** : Because Layers can be included or excluded differently depending on the settings of each [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) instance, there is the potential for a conflicting decision for whether contact should happen or not when two [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) instances come into contact with each other. You can find the detailed rules for how Unity arbitrates this decision in the [Collider2D.layerOverridePriority](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D-layerOverridePriority.html) documentation.
