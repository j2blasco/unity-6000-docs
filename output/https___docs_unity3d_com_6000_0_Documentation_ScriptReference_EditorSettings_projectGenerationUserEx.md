projectGenerationUserExtensions; 
### Description
Controls list of extensions of files that will be included in the c# .csproj projects that Unity generates.
Use this if you have certain file formats that you'd like to add to the .csproj files for convenient editing. This setting takes a semicolon-separated string of extensions. Leading dots are optional. This setting is specific to a project. 
```
