## Declaration
public void AddRelativeForce([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) force, [ForceMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.html) mode = ForceMode.Force); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
force | The force vector in local coordinates.  
mode | The type of force to apply.  
### Description
Applies a `force` to the Articulation Body, relative to its local coordinate system.
You can only apply a force to an active ArticulationBody. If a GameObject is inactive, AddRelativeForce has no effect.  
  
[ForceMode.Force](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.Force.html) and [ForceMode.Acceleration](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.Acceleration.html) modes modify the Linear Velocity Per Second accumulator and [ForceMode.Impulse](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.Impulse.html) and [ForceMode.VelocityChange](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.VelocityChange.html) modify the Linear Velocity Per Step accumulator. Mixing these 2 groups of ForceModes doesn't work for Articulation Bodies and will result in only the Linear Velocity Per Second accumulator being applied.  
  
For more information on how ForceMode affects velocity, see [Rigidbody.AddForce](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html).  
  
Applying a force to an ArticulationBody wakes up that body. If the force size is zero then the ArticulationBody does not wake up.   
Unit of measurement - N (newtons).
