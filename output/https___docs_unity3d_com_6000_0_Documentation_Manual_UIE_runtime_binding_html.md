# Runtime data binding
Runtime data binding binds the properties of any plain C# `object` to the properties of a UI control. You can use this type of data binding in both the runtime and Editor UI. However, for serialized data in the Editor UI, use the [SerializedObject data binding](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UIE-editor-binding.html) because it provides better support for Unityâ€™s [serialization system](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/script-serialization.html), including undo/redo functionality and multi-selection operations.
