### Description
JointLimits is used by the [HingeJoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html) to limit the joints angle.
Additional resources: [HingeJoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html).
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Set the hinge limits for a door.
        HingeJoint[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html) hinge = GetComponent<HingeJoint[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html)>();  
  
        JointLimits[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointLimits.html) limits = hinge.limits;
        limits.min = 0;
        limits.max = 90;
        limits.bounciness = 0;
        limits.bounceMinVelocity = 0;
        hinge.limits = limits;

### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[bounceMinVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointLimits-bounceMinVelocity.html) | The minimum impact velocity which will cause the joint to bounce.  
[bounciness](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointLimits-bounciness.html) | Determines the size of the bounce when the joint hits it's limit. Also known as restitution.  
[contactDistance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointLimits-contactDistance.html) | Distance inside the limit value at which the limit will be considered to be active by the solver.  
[max](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointLimits-max.html) | The upper angular limit (in degrees) of the joint.  
[min](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointLimits-min.html) | The lower angular limit (in degrees) of the joint.
