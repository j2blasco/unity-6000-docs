[PhysicsMaterialCombine2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsMaterialCombine2D.html) bounceCombine; 
### Description
The bounciness combine mode used by the [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html).
A [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) can have a [PhysicsMaterial2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsMaterial2D.html) assigned in several ways: directly through the [Collider2D.sharedMaterial](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D-sharedMaterial.html), indirectly through the attached [Rigidbody2D.sharedMaterial](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-sharedMaterial.html), or by using the global default. If no [PhysicsMaterial2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsMaterial2D.html) is assigned, a default value is used.
