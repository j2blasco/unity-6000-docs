### Description
Structure to hold scene data extracted from a SketchUp file.
When importing a SketchUp file, Unity retrieves all the scenes in the SketchUp file.  
  
This can be extracted later from [SketchUpImporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SketchUpImporter.html) with [SketchUpImporter.GetScenes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SketchUpImporter.GetScenes.html).
### Properties
