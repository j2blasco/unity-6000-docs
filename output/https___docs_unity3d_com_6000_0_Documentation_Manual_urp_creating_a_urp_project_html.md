# Creating a URP project
![URP 3D Sample](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/urp/AssetShots/Beauty/Template.png) URP 3D Sample
Create a new project that uses URP, or install URP into an existing project that uses the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).

[Create a new project that uses URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/creating-a-new-project-with-urp.html) | If you’re starting a new project from scratch, create a project using a template in the Unity Hub.  
[Scene templates](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/scene-templates.html) | Learn about the **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) templates you can use to quickly create scenes that include pre-configured URP-specific settings and **post-processing** A process that improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#post-processing) effects.  
[Import a package sample](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/package-samples.html) | Import a set of assets that you can use as a base to build upon or learn how to use a feature.  
[Package samples reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/package-sample-urp-package-samples.html) | Learn about the package samples that URP provides.  
[Install URP into an existing project](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/InstallURPIntoAProject.html) | If you’ve started a project using the Built-In Render Pipeline, you can install URP and configure your project to use URP.
