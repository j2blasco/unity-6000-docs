## Declaration
public static void CollapseUndoOperations(int groupIndex); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
groupIndex | The group index to collapse undo operations to.  
### Description
Collapses all undo operations down to group index together into one step.
The current group index automatically increases on mouse down, by clicking on menu items, and other operations. This method collapses all undo operations with group indices above the provided group index to that group index. This is used by the color picker to combine all color modifications into a single step once the color picker is closed, while they are seperate operations when the color picker is still open.
