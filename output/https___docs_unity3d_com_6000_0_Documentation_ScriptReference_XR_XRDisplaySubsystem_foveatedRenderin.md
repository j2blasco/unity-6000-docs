foveatedRenderingLevel; 
### Description
Controls the intensity of the foveated rendering system.
Valid range is 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 0.0 will disable foveated rendering. A value of 1.0 will apply the maximum strength allowed by the platform and will usually provide the best GPU performance improvement. Changes to this value take effect the next time the scene begins rendering.
