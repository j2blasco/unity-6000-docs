# Shadows
![Scene with objects casting shadows](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/ShadowIntro.png) Scene with objects casting shadows
Shadows add a degree of depth and realism to a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) because they bring out the scale and position of objects that might otherwise look flat. In Unity, lights can cast shadows from a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)
