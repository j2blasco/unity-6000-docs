### Description
Low level interface for building scripts for Unity.

This is intended for internal use only; use the [Scriptable Build Pipeline package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.scriptablebuildpipeline@latest/index.html) to implement a fully featured build pipeline. You can install this via the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@latest/index.html).
