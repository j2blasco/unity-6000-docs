public [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) ClosestPoint([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) position); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
position | Location you want to find the closest point to.  
### Returns
**Vector3** The closest point on the collider, returned in world space coordinates. 
### Description
The closest point on the collider given a specified location.
This method computes the point on the Collider that is closest to a 3D location in the world. In the example below `closestPoint` is the point on the Collider and `location` is the point in 3D space. If `location` is in the Collider the `closestPoint` is inside. If the Collider is disabled, the method returns the input `position`.  
  
**Note:** The difference from [ClosestPointOnBounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.ClosestPointOnBounds.html) is that the returned point is actually on the collider instead of on the bounds of the collider. ([bounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider-bounds.html) is a box that surrounds the collider.)
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
// Note that closestPoint is based on the surface of the collider
// and location represents a point in 3d space.
// The gizmos work in the editor.
//
// Create an origin-based cube and give it a scale of (1, 0.5, 3).
// Change the BoxCollider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BoxCollider.html) size to (0.8, 1.2, 0.8).  This means that
// collisions will happen when a GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) gets close to the BoxCollider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BoxCollider.html).
// The ShowClosestPoint.cs script shows spheres that display the location
// and closestPoint.  Try changing the BoxCollider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BoxCollider.html) size and the location
// values.  
  
// Attach this to a GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) that has a Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) component attached
public class ShowClosestPoint : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) location;  
  
    public void OnDrawGizmos()
    {
        var collider = GetComponent<Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html)>();  
  
        if (!collider)
        {
            return; // nothing to do without a collider
        }  
  
        Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) closestPoint = collider.ClosestPoint(location);  
  
        Gizmos.DrawSphere[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.DrawSphere.html)(location, 0.1f);
        Gizmos.DrawWireSphere[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.DrawWireSphere.html)(closestPoint, 0.1f);
    }
}

**Note:** Same as [Physics.ClosestPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.ClosestPoint.html) but doesn't allow passing a custom position and rotation. Instead, it uses the position of the collider.
