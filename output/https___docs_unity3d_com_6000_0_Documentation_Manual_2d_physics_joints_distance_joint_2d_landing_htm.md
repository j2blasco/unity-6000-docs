# Distance Joint 2D
Techniques and resources for working with Distance **Joint** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint) 2D components.
