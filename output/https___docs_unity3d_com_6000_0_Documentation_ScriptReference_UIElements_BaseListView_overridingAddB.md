overridingAddButtonBehavior; 
### Description
This callback allows the user to implement a [DropdownMenu](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.DropdownMenu.html) when the Add Button is clicked. 
This callback will only be called if showAddRemoveFooter is set to `true`. Setting this callback to anything other than `null` will override the basic add behavior. This callback will override the onAdd callback.
