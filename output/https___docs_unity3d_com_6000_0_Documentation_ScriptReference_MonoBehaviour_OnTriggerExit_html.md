### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
other | The other Collider involved in this collision.  
### Description
OnTriggerExit is called when the [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) `other` has stopped touching the trigger.
This message is sent to the trigger and the collider that touches the trigger. **Note:** Trigger events are only sent if one of the colliders also has a rigidbody attached. Trigger events will be sent to disabled MonoBehaviours, to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions. Deactivating or destroying a Collider while it is inside a trigger volume will not register an on exit event.
```
// Destroy everything that leaves the trigger  
  
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnTriggerExit(Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) other)
    {
        Destroy(other.gameObject);
    }
}

```

OnTriggerExit can be a co-routine, simply use the yield statement in the function.
