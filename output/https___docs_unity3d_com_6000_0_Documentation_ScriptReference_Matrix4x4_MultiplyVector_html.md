## Declaration
public [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) MultiplyVector([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) vector); 
### Description
Transforms a direction by this matrix.
This function is similar to [MultiplyPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Matrix4x4.MultiplyPoint.html); but it transforms directions and not positions. When transforming a direction, only the rotation part of the matrix is taken into account.
