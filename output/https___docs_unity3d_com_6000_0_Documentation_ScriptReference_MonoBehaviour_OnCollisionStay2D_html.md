### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
other | The Collision2D data associated with this collision.  
### Description
Sent each frame where a collider on another object is touching this object's collider (2D physics only).
Further information about the objects involved is reported in the Collision2D parameter passed during the call. If you don't need this information then you can declare OnCollisionStay2D without the parameter.  
  
**Note:** Collision events will be sent to disabled MonoBehaviours, to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions. Collision stay events are not sent for sleeping Rigidbodies.
