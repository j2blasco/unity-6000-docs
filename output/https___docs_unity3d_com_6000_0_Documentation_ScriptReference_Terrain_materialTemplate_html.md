[Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html) materialTemplate; 
### Description
The custom material Unity uses to render the Terrain.
You can use this property to give the Terrain a custom material to render with.   
  
Unity doesn't make a copy of the custom material internally, so modifying `materialTemplate` will affect all Terrain objects that use the same material.
