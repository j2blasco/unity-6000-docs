IgnoreRaycastLayer; 
### Description
Layer mask constant to select ignore raycast layer.
This can be used in the layermask field of [Physics.Raycast](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html) and other methods to select the "ignore raycast" layer (which does not receive raycasts by default).
