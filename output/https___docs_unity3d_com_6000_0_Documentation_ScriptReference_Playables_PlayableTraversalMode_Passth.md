### Description
Causes the [Playable](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Playables.Playable.html) to act as a passthrough for PrepareFrame and ProcessFrame. If the [PlayableOutput](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Playables.PlayableOutput.html) being processed is connected to the n-th input port of the [Playable](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Playables.Playable.html), the [Playable](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Playables.Playable.html) only propagates the n-th output port. Use this enum value in conjunction with [PlayableOutput](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Playables.PlayableOutput.html) SetSourceOutputPort.
