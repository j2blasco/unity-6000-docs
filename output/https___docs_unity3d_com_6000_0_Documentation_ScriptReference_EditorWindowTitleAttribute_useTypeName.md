useTypeNameAsIconName; 
### Description
When set to true Unity sets the window's icon name to be the same as its type name.
This is useful for common window types that are likely to have icons already. For example, if your window is an InspectorWindow, you can set this property to true to use the Unity Inspector window icon automatically.
