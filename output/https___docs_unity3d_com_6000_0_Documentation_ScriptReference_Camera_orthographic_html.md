orthographic; 
### Description
Is the camera orthographic (_true_) or perspective (_false_)?
When ortho is _true_ , camera's viewing volume is defined by [orthographicSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-orthographicSize.html).  
When orthographic is _false_ , camera's viewing volume is defined by [fieldOfView](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-fieldOfView.html).  
  
NOTE: Deferred rendering is not supported when using Orthographic projection. If the camera's projection mode is set to Orthographic, the camera will always use Forward rendering.
