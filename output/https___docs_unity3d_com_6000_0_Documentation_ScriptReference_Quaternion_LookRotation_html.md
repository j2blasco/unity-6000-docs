## Declaration
public static [Quaternion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) LookRotation([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) forward, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) upwards = Vector3.up); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
forward | The direction to look in.  
upwards | The vector that defines in which direction up is.  
### Description
Creates a rotation with the specified `forward` and `upwards` directions.
Z axis will be aligned with `forward`, X axis aligned with cross product between `forward` and `upwards`, and Y axis aligned with cross product between Z and X.  
  
Returns identity if the magnitude of `forward` is zero.   
If `forward` and `upwards` are colinear, or if the magnitude of `upwards` is zero, the result is the same as [Quaternion.FromToRotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.FromToRotation.html) with `fromDirection` set to the positive Z-axis (0, 0, 1) and `toDirection` set to the normalized `forward` direction.
