using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Animation[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animation.html) anim;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        // Enable the walk cycle
        anim["Walk"].enabled = true;
        anim["Walk"].weight = 1.0f;
