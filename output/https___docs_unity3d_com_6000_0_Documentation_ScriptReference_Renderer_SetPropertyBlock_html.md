## Declaration
public void SetPropertyBlock([MaterialPropertyBlock](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MaterialPropertyBlock.html) properties); 
## Declaration
public void SetPropertyBlock([MaterialPropertyBlock](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MaterialPropertyBlock.html) properties, int materialIndex); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
properties | Property block with values you want to override.  
materialIndex | The index of the Material you want to override the parameters of. The index ranges from 0 to Renderer.sharedMaterials.Length-1.  
### Description
Lets you set or clear per-renderer or per-material parameter overrides.
This is recommended when only a few properties of a Material are different per object. This is more memory efficient than having one complete distinct Material per object.  
  
You can also provide a Material index (from 0 to Renderer.materials.Length-1). In this case, only parameters of that Material are set. If there is both a per-renderer and a per-material block, only the per-Material block is used.  
  
To disable any of per-Renderer or per-Material overrides, pass null as the propertyâ€™s argument.
