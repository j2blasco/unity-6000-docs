Creating, loading, and saving Scenes
# Introduction to scenes
Scenes are where you work with content in Unity. They are assets that contain all or part of a game or application. For example, you might build a simple game in a single **scene** , while for a more complex game, you might use one scene per level, each with its own environments, characters, obstacles, decorations, and UI. You can create any number of scenes in a project.
When you create a new project and open it for the first time, Unity opens a sample scene that contains only a **Camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) and a Light.

For information about working with scenes, see [Creating, loading, and saving scenes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scenes-working-with.html).
## Scene Templates
Unity uses scene templates to create new scenes. Scene templates are assets that are stored in a project. They are similar to scenes, but are designed to be copied rather than used directly.
For information about creating and using scene templates, see [Scene templates](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scene-templates.html).
## The New Scene dialog
The New Scene dialog opens when you create a new scene from the File menu: (**File** > **New Scene**) or the **Ctrl/Cmd + n** shortcut. Use it to create new scenes from specific scene templates in your project, and get information about existing templates.

_The New Scene dialog_
  1. **Search field:** find available scene templates by name.
  2. **Templates:** a list of all available templates in the project.
  3. **Template details:** displays information about the currently selected template.
  4. **Command bar:** provides commands and options for creating a new scene from the selected template.


### Creating a new scene
To create a new scene from the New Scene dialog, select a template from the templates list, and click **Create**. For a detailed description of creating a scene this way, see [Creating a new scene from the New Scene dialog](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scenes-working-with.html#creating-a-new-scene-from-the-new-scene-dialog).
### Pinning templates
Pinned templates appear before other templates in the New Scene dialogâ€™s template list. The last template pinned appears at the top of the list.
You can pin a template in one of the following ways:
  * In the [New Scene dialog](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html#new-scene-dialog), click the pin icon in the bottom right of the template .
  * In the [scene template Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scene-templates-editing.html), enable the **Pin in New Scene Dialog** option.


### Locating and editing templates
When you select a template in the [New Scene dialog](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html#new-scene-dialog), the details pane displays the path to the template.
To highlight the template in the **Project window** A window that shows the contents of your `Assets` folder (Project tab) [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ProjectView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Projectwindow), select the **Locate** link.
To open the template in an **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector) window and [edit its properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scene-templates-editing.html), select the **Edit** link.
## Multi-scene editing
You can open multiple scenes for editing at the same time. For details, see [Multi-scene editing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/MultiSceneEditing.html).
