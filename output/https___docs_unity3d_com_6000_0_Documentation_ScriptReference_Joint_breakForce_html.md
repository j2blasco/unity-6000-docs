breakForce; 
### Description
The force that needs to be applied for this joint to break.
The force might come from collisions with other objects, forces applied with [Rigidbody.AddTorque](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddTorque.html) or from other joints. The break force can be set to [Mathf.Infinity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mathf.Infinity.html) to render the joint unbreakable. Additional resources: [Joint.OnJointBreak](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint.OnJointBreak.html).
