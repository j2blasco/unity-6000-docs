# Enable Rendering Layers for Decals in URP
To enable Rendering Layers for decals in your project:
  1. In the **Project** window, select a Renderer asset with a [Decal Renderer Feature](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/renderer-feature-decal.html).
  2. In the Decal Renderer Feature, enable **Use Rendering Layers**.


When you enable Rendering Layers for Decals, Unity shows the **Rendering Layers** property on each Decal Projector.
## Example
This section describes how to configure the following application example:
  * The **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) contains a Decal Projector.
  * The Decal Projector projects a decal on the wall and the ground, but not on the paint bucket.


The following illustration shows the example:
![In image 1, the paint bucket has the Receive decals layer selected. In image 2 it does not, so the Decal Projector does not project on the bucket.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/urp/lighting/rendering-layers/rendering-layers-decal-example.png)  
_In image`1` , the paint bucket has the `Receive decals` layer selected. In image `2` it does not, so the Decal Projector does not project on the bucket._
To implement the example:
  1. Enable Rendering Layers for Decals in your project.
  2. [Create a Decal Projector](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/renderer-feature-decal-create.html) in the scene.
  3. Go to **Project Settings** > **Tags and Layers**. Add a Rendering Layer called `Receive decals`.
  4. Select the Decal Projector. In the Rendering Layers property, select `Receive decals`.
  5. Select the paint bucket **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject). In the **Rendering**Layer Mask** A value defining which layers to include or exclude from an operation, such as rendering, collision or your own code. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Layers.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#LayerMask)** field, clear the `Receive decals` layer. Now the Decal Projector does not affect this GameObject.
