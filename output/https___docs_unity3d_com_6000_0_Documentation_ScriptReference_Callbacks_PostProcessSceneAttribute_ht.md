### Description
Add this attribute to a method to get a notification just after building the Scene.
A method with this attribute will also get called when entering Playmode, when [SceneManager.LoadScene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html) is called.  
  
`PostProcessSceneAttribute` has an option to provide an order index in the callback, starting at 0. This is useful if you have more than one OnPostprocessScene callback, and you would like them to be called in a certain order. Callbacks are called in order, starting at zero.  
  
**Note:** If there are no new changes to the scene since the previous Player build, Unity doesn't rebuild the scene but uses cached Player data instead. In this case the `PostProcessSceneAttribute` callback is not called. To ensure an unchanged scene rebuilds, you can either mark the scene dirty with [EditorSceneManager.MarkSceneDirty](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.MarkSceneDirty.html) or clear the build cache with [BuildOptions.CleanBuildCache](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildOptions.CleanBuildCache.html).
