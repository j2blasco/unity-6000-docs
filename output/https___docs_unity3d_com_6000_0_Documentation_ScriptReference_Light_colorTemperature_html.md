### Description
The color temperature of the light. Correlated Color Temperature (abbreviated as CCT) is multiplied with the color filter when calculating the final color of a light source. The color temperature of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from an ideal black body is defined as its surface temperature in Kelvin. White is 6500K according to the D65 standard. A candle light is 1800K and a soft warm light bulb is 2700K. If you want to use colorTemperature, GraphicsSettings.lightsUseLinearIntensity and Light.useColorTemperature has to be enabled.
