# Create a mesh
You can add meshes to a Unity project in the following ways:
  * Create a **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Mesh) as part of a [model](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/models.html)A 3D model representation of an object, such as a character, a building, or a piece of furniture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/3D-formats.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Model) in a 3D modeling program, then import it. Unity creates a mesh asset as a part of the model hierarchy when you import a model. For more information, see [Importing Models](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ImportingModelFiles.html).
  * Create a mesh directly with in-Editor tools. Unity has built-in primitive shapes such as spheres and capsules that you can place directly into a **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene). You can also use a package like [ProBuilder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.probuilder@latest) to model a custom mesh in the Editor.
  * [Create meshes with code](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-meshes.html), either at runtime or in the Editor.
