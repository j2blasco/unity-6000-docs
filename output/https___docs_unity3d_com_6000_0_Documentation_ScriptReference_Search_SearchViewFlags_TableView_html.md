The Search Picker window will open in table view.
This can be useful if you want to use a search expression to display selected (that is using a select{} statement) values in a Search table.
```
[SearchContext[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Search.SearchContext.html)("select{p:t:material, @label, @size}", "expression;asset", SearchViewFlags.TableView[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Search.SearchViewFlags.TableView.html))]
