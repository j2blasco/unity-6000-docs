using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
  
public class Example
{
    public static void TimeSynchronousMethodWithMarkers()
    {
        var recorder = Recorder.Get[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder.Get.html)("MyMarker");
        recorder.enabled = true; // Starts measurements  
  
        // Call method which uses MyMarker
        // MyMethod();  
  
        recorder.enabled = false; // Stops measurements and makes data available immediately
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("MyMarker total time, ns: " + recorder.elapsedNanoseconds);
