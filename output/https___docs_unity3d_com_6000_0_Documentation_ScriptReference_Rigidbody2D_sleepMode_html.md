[RigidbodySleepMode2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodySleepMode2D.html) sleepMode; 
### Description
The sleep state that the rigidbody will initially be in.
_Sleeping_ is an optimisation that is used to temporarily remove an object from physics simulation when it is at rest. This property chooses whether the rigidbody should start off asleep, awake or have sleeping turned off altogether.  
  
For more information about Rigidbody sleeping, refer to the [Physics Overview](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PhysicsOverview.html).
