sqrMagnitude; 
### Description
Returns the squared length of this vector (Read Only).
Calculating the squared magnitude instead of the [magnitude](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2Int-magnitude.html) is much faster.  
  
Often if you are comparing magnitudes of two vectors you can just compare their squared magnitudes.  
  
Additional resources: [magnitude](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2Int-magnitude.html).
