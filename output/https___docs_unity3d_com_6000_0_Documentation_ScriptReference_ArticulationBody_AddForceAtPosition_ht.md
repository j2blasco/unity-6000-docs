## Declaration
public void AddForceAtPosition([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) force, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) position, [ForceMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.html) mode = ForceMode.Force); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
force | The force vector in world coordinates.  
position | A position in world coordinates.  
mode | The type of force to apply.  
### Description
Applies a `force` at a specific `position`, resulting in applying a torque and force on the object.
For realistic effects, `position` should be approximately in the range of the surface of the Articulation Body. This is ideal for simulating explosions. To create realistic explosions, apply forces over several frames instead of just one. Note that when `position` is far away from the center of the Articulation Body, the applied torque will be unrealistically large.  
  
You can only apply a force to an active ArticulationBody. If a GameObject is inactive, AddForceAtPosition has no effect.  
  
[ForceMode.Force](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.Force.html) mode modifies the Linear Velocity Per Second and Angular Velicity Per Second accumulators and [ForceMode.Impulse](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.Impulse.html) mode modifies the Linear Velocity Per Step and Angular Velocity Per Step accumulators. Mixing these 2 ForceModes doesn't work for Articulation Bodies and will result in only the Linear Velocity Per Second accumulator being applied.  
  
For more information on how ForceMode affects velocity, see [Rigidbody.AddForce](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html).  
  
Applying a force to an ArticulationBody wakes up that body. If the force size is zero then the ArticulationBody does not wake up.   
Unit of measurement - N (newtons).  
  
**This method does not support**[ForceMode.Acceleration](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.Acceleration.html)**and**[ForceMode.VelocityChange](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ForceMode.VelocityChange.html)**.**
