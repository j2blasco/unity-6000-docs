## Declaration
public [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) GetRelativePointVelocity([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) relativePoint); 
### Description
The velocity relative to the rigidbody at the point `relativePoint`.
GetRelativePointVelocity will take the angularVelocity of the rigidbody into account when calculating the velocity.

using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) rb;

        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)>();
    }  
  
    // Get the velocity of a wheel, specified by its position in local space.
    // This method assumes that the wheel is a child of the Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html), or that the wheel translates relative to the Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html).

    {
