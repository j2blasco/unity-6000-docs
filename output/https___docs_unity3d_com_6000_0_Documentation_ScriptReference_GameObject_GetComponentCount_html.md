## Declaration
public int GetComponentCount(); 
### Returns
**int** The number of components on the GameObject as an Integer value. 
### Description
Retrieves the total number of components currently attached to the GameObject.
You can use `GetComponentCount` to iterate through component indices, which is especially convenient if used together with [GameObject.GetComponentAtIndex](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponentAtIndex.html). For example, you can iterate through the indices to find the index of a particular component you're interested in and then save the index for later use. 
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class IterateComponents : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
int m_SavedComponentIndex = -1;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        //Iterate through components  on the GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html)
        for (int i = 0; i < gameObject.GetComponentCount(); i++)
        {
            var currComponent = gameObject.GetComponentAtIndex(i);
            
            //Check if it is a Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) component
            if (currComponent.GetType() == typeof(Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)) )
            {
                m_SavedComponentIndex = i;
            }
        }  
  
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)(m_SavedComponentIndex != -1 ? $"Found component at index: {m_SavedComponentIndex}" : "Could not find component");
    }
}

```
