## Declaration
public static bool GetButton(string buttonName); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
buttonName | The name of the button such as Jump.  
### Returns
**bool** True when an axis has been pressed and not released. 
### Description
Returns true while the virtual button identified by `buttonName` is held down.
**Note** : This API is part of the legacy Input Manager. The recommended best practice is that you don't use this API in new projects. For new projects, use the Input System package. To learn more about input, refer to [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Input.html).  
  
Think auto fire - this will return true as long as the button is held down. Use this only when implementing events that trigger an action, eg, shooting a weapon. The `buttonName` argument will normally be one of the names in [InputManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-InputManager.html) such as Jump or Fire1. [GetButton](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetButton.html) will return to `false` when it is released.  
  
**Note:** Use [GetAxis](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html) for input that controls continuous movement.
