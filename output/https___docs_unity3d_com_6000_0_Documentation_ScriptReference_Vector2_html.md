### Description
Representation of 2D vectors and points.
This structure is used in some places to represent 2D positions and vectors (e.g. texture coordinates in a [Mesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.html) or texture offsets in [Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html)). In the majority of other cases a Vector3 is used.
### Static Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[down](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-down.html) | Shorthand for writing Vector2(0, -1).  
[left](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-left.html) | Shorthand for writing Vector2(-1, 0).  
[negativeInfinity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-negativeInfinity.html) | Shorthand for writing Vector2(float.NegativeInfinity, float.NegativeInfinity).  
[one](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-one.html) | Shorthand for writing Vector2(1, 1).  
[positiveInfinity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-positiveInfinity.html) | Shorthand for writing Vector2(float.PositiveInfinity, float.PositiveInfinity).  
[right](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-right.html) | Shorthand for writing Vector2(1, 0).

### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[magnitude](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-magnitude.html) | Returns the length of this vector (Read Only).

[this[int]](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.Index_operator.html) | Access the x or y component using [0] or [1] respectively.  
[x](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-x.html) | X component of the vector.  
[y](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-y.html) | Y component of the vector.  
### Constructors
Constructor | Description  
---|---  
[Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-ctor.html) | Constructs a new vector with given x, y components.  
### Public Methods
Method | Description  
---|---
