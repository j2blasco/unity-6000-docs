Introduction to character control
# Character control
In a first-person or third-person application, a user’s character or **avatar** An interface for retargeting animation from one rig to another. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ConfiguringtheAvatar.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Avatar) usually needs some collision-based physics, so that it doesn’t fall through the floor or walk through walls. In 3D physics, you can create and configure character physics and control with a Character Controller.
You can configure character control via the [`CharacterController`](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CharacterController.html) class, or the corresponding [Character Controller](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-CharacterController.html)A simple, capsule-shaped collider component with specialized features for behaving as a character in a game. Unlike true collider components, a Rigidbody is not needed and the momentum effects are not realistic.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#CharacterController) component.
