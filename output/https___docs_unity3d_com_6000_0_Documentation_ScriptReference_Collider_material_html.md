public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Expose properties in the inspector for easy adjustment.
    float dynFriction;
    float statFriction;  
  
    Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) coll;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        coll = GetComponent<Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html)>();  
  
        coll.material.dynamicFriction = dynFriction;
