[Quaternion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) rotationUniform; 
### Description
Returns a random rotation with uniform distribution (Read Only).
Employs [Hopf fibration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_fibration) to return a random [Quaternion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) within a uniformly distributed selection space. Gives higher quality results compared to the more naive approach employed by [rotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random-rotation.html), though at a 40% performance cost.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Sets a random orientation for the object.
        transform.rotation = Random.rotationUniform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random-rotationUniform.html);
    }
}

```
