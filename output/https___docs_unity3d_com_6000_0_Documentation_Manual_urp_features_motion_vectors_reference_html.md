# Motion vectors settings reference for URP
To specify how a GameObject contributes to the motion vector buffer, use the **Motion Vectors** property: **Mesh Renderer** >> **Additional Settings** >> **Motion Vectors**. This property lets you disable motion vector rendering for a specific object, or fill the motion vector texture with zeros for the visible fragments of the objectâ€™s renderer.
The following table describes the available **Motion Vectors** property options.
**Motion Vectors** option | Description  
---|---  
**Camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) Motion Only | Unity treats the object as stationary in the world when rendering camera motion vectors. Unity does not draw a per-object motion vector pass for this MeshRenderer. If motion vector rendering is a GPU bottleneck, you can use this option as an optimization for objects which move slowly.  
Per Object Motion | Unity renders the per-object **Motion Vectors** pass for this object.  
Force No Motion | Unity renders the per-object **Motion Vectors** pass every frame for this object, but sets a special shader uniform variable to tell the pass to skip calculations and to write zero values. A per-object pass is still necessary to overwrite any non-zero camera motion vectors from the full-screen pass.  
You can use this option to avoid artefacts from the camera motion blur on a 3D HUD, or a third person character, or a race car, or if you have some other artefacts related to incorrect motion vectors on an object that you would like to avoid.
