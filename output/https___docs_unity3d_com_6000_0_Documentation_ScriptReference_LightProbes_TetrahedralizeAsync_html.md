## Declaration
public static void TetrahedralizeAsync(); 
### Description
Asynchronously tetrahedralize all currently loaded LightProbe positions.
Call this function to asynchronously calculate a Delaunay tetrahedralization of all currently loaded LightProbe positions, and update the [LightProbes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightProbes.html) object with the result. Note that Unity does not raise an event when this asynchronous method completes.  
  
Call this method after you load a Scene with [LoadSceneMode.Additive](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.LoadSceneMode.Additive.html), or unload a Scene with [SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync.html). Note that updating the tetrahedral tessellation is CPU-intensive. For more information, see [Light Probes and Scene loading](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/light-probes-and-scene-loading.html).
