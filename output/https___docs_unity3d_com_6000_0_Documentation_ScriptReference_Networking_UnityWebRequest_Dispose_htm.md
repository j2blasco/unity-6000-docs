## Declaration
public void Dispose(); 
### Description
Signals that this [UnityWebRequest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) is no longer being used, and should clean up any resources it is using.
You must call Dispose once you have finished using a [UnityWebRequest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) object, regardless of whether the request succeeded or failed.  
  
For safety, it is usually a best practice to employ the [using statement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yh598w02.aspx) to ensure that a [UnityWebRequest] is properly cleaned up in case of uncaught exceptions.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Networking;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class MyExampleBehaviour : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public IEnumerator Start()
    {
        using (UnityWebRequest[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) request = UnityWebRequest.Get[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.Get.html)("https://my-website.com"))
        {
            yield return request.SendWebRequest();
            Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Server responded: " + request.downloadHandler.text);
        }
    }
