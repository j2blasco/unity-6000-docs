[BuildCompression](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildCompression.html) LZMA; 
### Description
LZMA Compression.
LZMA-Compressed bundles give the smallest possible download size, but have relatively slow decompression resulting in higher apparent load times and greater memory use at runtime.  
  
This BuildCompression is only supported for building Asset Bundles and is not available for recompression at runtime.
