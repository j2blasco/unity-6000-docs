### Description
The grayscale value of the color. (Read Only)
Unity uses the following formula to calculate the grayscale value: `(0.299f * Color.r) + (0.587f * Color.g) + (0.114f * Color.b)`.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Color[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color.html) newColor = new Color[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color.html)(0.3f, 0.4f, 0.6f);
        print(newColor.grayscale);
    }
}
