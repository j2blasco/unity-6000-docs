[AdditionalCanvasShaderChannels](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AdditionalCanvasShaderChannels.html) additionalShaderChannels; 
### Description
Get or set the mask of additional shader channels to be used when creating the [Canvas](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Canvas.html) mesh.
The [Canvas](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Canvas.html) will always include Position, Color, and Uv0 shader channels when generating the mesh for a overlay [Canvas](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Canvas.html) and will also include Normal and Tangent for ScreenSpace.Camera and World space [Canvas](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Canvas.html). These are the optional additional parameters to be copied.
