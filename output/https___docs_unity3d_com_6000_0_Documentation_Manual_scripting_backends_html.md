# Scripting backends
Unity has two scripting back ends: **Mono** and ****IL2CPP** A Unity-developed scripting back-end which you can use as an alternative to Mono when building projects for some platforms. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scripting-backends-il2cpp.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#IL2CPP)** (Intermediate Language To C++), each of which uses a different compilation technique:
  * Mono uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation and compiles code on demand at runtime.
  * IL2CPP uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and compiles your entire application before it runs.


This section contains further information about these back ends:
