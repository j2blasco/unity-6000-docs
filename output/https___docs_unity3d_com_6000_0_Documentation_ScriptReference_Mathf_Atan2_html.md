## Declaration
public static float Atan2(float y, float x); 
### Description
Returns the angle in radians whose [Tan](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mathf.Tan.html) is `y/x`.
Return value is the angle between the x-axis and a 2D vector starting at zero and terminating at (x,y).  
  
**Note:** This function takes account of the cases where x is zero and returns the correct angle rather than throwing a division by zero exception.
```
// Usually you use transform.LookAt for this.
// But this can give you more control over the angle
