### Description
The RequireComponent attribute automatically adds required components as dependencies.
When you add a script which uses RequireComponent to a GameObject, the required component is automatically added to the GameObject. This is useful to avoid setup errors. For example a script might require that a Rigidbody is always added to the same GameObject. When you use RequireComponent, this is done automatically, so you are unlikely to get the setup wrong.  
  
**Note:** RequireComponent only checks for missing dependencies when [GameObject.AddComponent](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.AddComponent.html) is called. This happens both in the Editor, or at runtime. Unity does not automatically add any missing dependences to the components with GameObjects that lack the new dependencies.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
// PlayerScript requires the GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) to have a Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) component
[RequireComponent[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RequireComponent.html)(typeof(Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)))]
public class PlayerScript : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) rb;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)>();
    }  
  
    void FixedUpdate[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
    {
        rb.AddForce(Vector3.up[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-up.html));
    }
}
