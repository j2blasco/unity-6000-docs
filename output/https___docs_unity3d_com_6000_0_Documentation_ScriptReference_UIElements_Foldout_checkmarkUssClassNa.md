### Description
The USS class name for the Label element in a Foldout. 
Unity adds this USS class to the [VisualElement](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.VisualElement.html) that represents the checkmark of the [Toggle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Toggle.html) sub-element of every [Foldout](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Foldout.html). Any styling applied to this class affects every foldout container located beside, or below the stylesheet in the visual tree.
