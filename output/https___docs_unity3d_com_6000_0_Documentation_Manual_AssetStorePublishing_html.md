# Publish to the Asset Store
This is the workflow to publish your assets to the **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore):
  1. [Create your Publisher Account](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreCreateAcct.html).
  2. [Create a new package draft](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreCreatePkg.html). You can also [delete your draft](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreDeletePkg.html) at any time and create a new draft.
  3. [Upload the assets into the package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreUpload.html).
  4. [Finalize the package details](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStorePkgDetails.html).
  5. [Submit the package for approval](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreSubmit.html).
  6. [View the status of your Asset Store submissions](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreStatus.html).


While you wait to hear whether Unity has accepted your package to the Asset Store, you can [set up your payout profile](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStorePayouts.html), so you can collect revenue from your packages. If you haven’t already done this, you can also [set up customer support for your publisher account](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreSupport.html).
After your package is on the Asset Store, you can take these actions to improve discoverability and encourage customers to buy your package:
  * [Add tags to your package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreMassLabeler.html) to make it easier for your customers to find it.
  * [Connecting your account to Google Analytics](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAnalytics.html) to track website traffic to your package page on the Asset Store.
  * Unity might offer you the chance to include your package in an Asset Store sales promotion. You can either [participate in Unity’s sales promotion or set up one of your own](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStorePromotion.html).
  * Authorize Unity [to refund your customers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreRefunding.html) for a package.


If you want to update or enhance an existing package, you can [create a major upgrade version](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreUpgrade.html). After your upgrade is published to the Asset Store, you can [deprecate your old package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreRemoving.html) so that new users only find the most recent version. You can also create a “lite” upgrade version, so customers can test out your package without spending the full amount.
You can use the tabs on your Publisher Account page to: 
  * Read the [Reviews](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#reviews) about your packages.
  * Check [Sales](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#sales) and [Revenue](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#revenue).
  * See the statistics on your package [Downloads](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#downloads) and any [Vouchers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#vouchers) you issued to customers.
  * Manage the [Users](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#users) on your team.
  * Manage your account [Info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#info).


For additional help with any of these procedures, refer to the online [Asset Store FAQ](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/sections/201163815-Asset-Store-Publishers-) and the [Asset Store forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/assets-and-asset-store.32/). Publishers who have an asset accepted to the Asset Store can also apply to join [the Publisher’s forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/asset-store-publishers.91/).
## Concepts
Here are some important concepts you need to know about publishing to the Unity Asset Store:
**Concept:** | **Definition:**  
---|---  
**Unity ID (account)** | Your user account for use in Unity. Your Unity ID enables you to buy subscriptions, manage your Projects and collaborate with teams, and acquire tools and samples on the Asset Store.  
  
You can only access and manage your Asset Store purchases when you’re logged in with your Unity account. If you decide to create a publisher account, you also need your Unity account.  
**Publisher account** | This account is tied to your Unity account, but it also gives you access to creating and publishing packages, setting up payouts, viewing sales and revenues, and managing all aspects of your profile on the Asset Store.  
**Payout profiles** | Payout profiles let you specify how (and how often) Unity pays you for your Asset sales, and whether Unity needs to withhold taxes (as some tax authorities require). Payout profiles are associated with [Organizations](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/organizations). You must be the Organization’s [Owner](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/organizations/members-groups-roles) to see, create or update its payout profile. For more information, refer to [Managing your Organization](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/organizations#membersandgroups).  
**Asset Store Tools** | You need [these tools](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/asset-store-publishing-tools-115) to be able to create packages to sell on the Asset Store from inside Unity. You can get them from the Asset Store itself: they’re like any other Asset available on the store. Download the tools to your computer and import them into your Project.  
  
The **Asset Store Tools** package also includes [the Validator tool](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreUpload.html#ValidatorTool), which you can use to check your Asset Store package before uploading and submitting it for review. Validating your package with this tool is part of the review process that the Asset Store curation team performs on your Assets when you submit a package to the Asset Store, so running it on your package can reduce the reviewing time. However, the Validator tool can’t completely simulate the approval process and might sometimes give false positives.  
**Package status** | Describes what part of the package lifecycle each package is at. For more information, refer to [Package status](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStoreAdmin.html#pkg-status).
