### Description
Set to true to build an Android App Bundle (aab file) instead of an apk. The default value is false.
This property is only applicable to builds for Google Play. You can also set this property in the Unity Editor using the [Build App Bundle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/android-build-settings.html) setting in the **Build Profiles** window for Android.  
  
When this property is true, the [PlayerSettings.Android.buildApkPerCpuArchitecture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings.Android-buildApkPerCpuArchitecture.html) property is ignored.
