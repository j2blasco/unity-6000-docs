# Hinge Joint 2D
Techniques and resources for working with Hinge **Joint** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint) 2D components.

[Hinge Joint 2D fundamentals](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/hinge-joint-2d-fundamentals.html) | Understand the **Hinge Joint** A joint that groups together two Rigidbody components, constraining them to move like they are connected by a hinge. It is perfect for doors, but can also be used to model chains, pendulums and so on. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-HingeJoint.html)
