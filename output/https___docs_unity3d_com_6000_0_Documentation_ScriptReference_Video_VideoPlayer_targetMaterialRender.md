### Description

Setting this to null causes the [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) to use the first [Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer.html) of the current [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html).
