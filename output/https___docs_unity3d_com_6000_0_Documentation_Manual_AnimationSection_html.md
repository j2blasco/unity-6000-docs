Mecanim Animation system
# Animation
An animation system provides tools and processes to animate the properties of models and assets. For example, use an animation system to animate transform properties to move and rotate a model, or animate the intensity property to dim a light.
Common tools include importers that import animation and models, editors that create and modify animation, and real-time animation **state machines** The set of states in an Animator Controller that a character or animated GameObject can be in, along with a set of transitions between those states and a variable to remember the current state. The states available will depend on the type of gameplay, but typical states include things like idling, walking, running and jumping. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/StateMachineBasics.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#StateMachine) that determine which animation plays and when. Some animation systems also include specialized tools that define a humanoid model and retarget animation between models with the same definition.
Unity has two animation systems with different capabilities and performance characteristics:
**Animation system** | **Description**  
---|---  
**[Mecanim animation system](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationOverview.html)** | The Mecanim animation system (Mecanim) is a rich and sophisticated animation system that uses the [Animator component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Animator.html)A component on a model that animates that model using the Animation system. The component has a reference to an Animator Controller asset that controls the animation. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-AnimatorController.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AnimatorComponent), the [Animation window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationEditorGuide.html), and the [Animator window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimatorWindow.html)The window where the Animator Controller is visualized and edited. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimatorWindow.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AnimatorWindow). Mecanim is the recommended animation system for most situations. It provides better performance for complex character animation with many [animation curves](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationCurvesOnImportedClips.html)Allows you to add data to an imported clip so you can animate the timings of other items based on the state of an animator. For example, for a game set in icy conditions, you could use an extra animation curve to control the emission rate of a particle system to show the player‚Äôs condensing breath in the cold air. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationCurvesOnImportedClips.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AnimationCurves) and [blending](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-BlendTree.html).  
**[Legacy animation system](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Animations.html)** | Unity‚Äôs Legacy animation system (Legacy) has a limited **feature set** A feature set is a collection of related packages that you can use to achieve specific results in the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in Unity‚Äôs Package Manager. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Featureset) that predates Mecanim. Legacy uses the [Animation component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Animation.html) and the special **Legacy** import option in the [Rig tab of the Import Settings window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/FBXImporter-Rig.html). Legacy is less complex for simple animation. Legacy is still available for backward compatibility with old Unity projects.
