### Description
Enable the Terrain holes Texture compression.
Set to `true` to compress the Terrain holes Texture. This property takes effect only at runtime, and is `true` by default. Terrain holes Textures are never compressed in the Editor. See [TerrainData.holesTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TerrainData-holesTexture.html) for details.
