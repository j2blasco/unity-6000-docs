Make a GameObject compatible with the GPU Resident Drawer in URP
# Enable the GPU Resident Drawer in URP
The GPU Resident Drawer automatically uses the [`BatchRendererGroup`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/batch-renderer-group.html) API to draw **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) with GPU instancing, which reduces the number of draw calls and frees CPU processing time. For more information, refer to [How BatchRendererGroup works](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/batch-renderer-group-how.html).
The GPU Resident Drawer works only with the following:
  * The [Forward+](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/rendering/forward-rendering-paths.html) **rendering path** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#RenderingPath).
  * [Graphics APIs](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GraphicsAPIs.html) and platforms that support compute **shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader), except OpenGL ES.
  * GameObjects that have a [Mesh Renderer component](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshRenderer.html).


Otherwise, Unity falls back to drawing the GameObject without GPU instancing.
If you enable the GPU Resident Drawer, the following applies:
  * Build times are longer because Unity compiles all the `BatchRendererGroup` shader variants into your build.


## Enable the GPU Resident Drawer
Follow these steps:
  1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Graphics** , then in the **Shader Stripping** section set **BatchRendererGroup Variants** to **Keep All**.
  2. Go to the active [URP Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/universalrp-asset.html) and enable **SRP Batcher**.
  3. Double-click the renderer in the **Renderer List** to open the Universal Renderer, then set **Rendering Path** to **Forward+**.
  4. Set **GPU Resident Drawer** to **Instanced Drawing**.


If you change or create GameObjects each frame, the GPU Resident Drawer updates with the changes.
To include or exclude GameObjects from the GPU Resident Drawer, refer to [Make a GameObject compatible with the GPU Resident Drawer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/make-object-compatible-gpu-rendering.html).
## Analyze the GPU Resident Drawer
To analyze the results of the GPU Resident Drawer, you can use the following:
  * [Frame Debugger](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FrameDebugger.html). The GPU Resident Drawer groups GameObjects into draw calls with the name **Hybrid Batch Group**.
  * [Rendering Debugger](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/features/rendering-debugger-reference.html).
  * [Rendering Statistics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RenderingStatistics.html) to check if the number of **frames per second** The frequency at which consecutive frames are displayed in a running game. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderingStatistics.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#framespersecond) increases, and the CPU processing time and SetPass calls decreases.
  * [Unity Profiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/optimize-for-better-performance.html)


## Optimize the GPU Resident Drawer
How much the GPU Resident Drawer speeds up rendering depends on your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene). The GPU Resident Drawer is most effective in the following setups:
  * The scene is large.
  * Multiple GameObjects use the same **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Mesh), so Unity can group them into a single draw call.


Rendering usually speeds up less in the **Scene view** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SceneView) and the Game view, compared to Play mode or your final built project.
The following might speed up the GPU Resident Drawer:
  * Go to **Project Settings** > **Player** , then in the **Other Settings** section disable **Static Batching**.
  * Go to **Window** > **Panels** > **Lighting** , then in the **Lightmapping Settings** section enable **Fixed Lightmap Size** and disable **Use Mipmap Limits**.
