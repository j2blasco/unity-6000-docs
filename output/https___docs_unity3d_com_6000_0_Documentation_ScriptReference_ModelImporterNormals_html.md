### Description
Normal generation options for [ModelImporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporter.html).
Normals can either be imported from the Model file (default), calculated by Unity, or not included in the imported Mesh at all. Vertex normals are most often used for real-time lighting.
