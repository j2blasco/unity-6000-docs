### Description
The [BuildFile.role](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Build.Reporting.BuildFile-role.html) value of the main Unity runtime when it is built as a separate library.
On most platforms, the Unity runtime is also the main executable for the player, but on some platforms it is split into a separate file, allowing the main executable to be smaller and more easily customized.
