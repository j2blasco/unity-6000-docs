# Simulating real-world cameras with Physical Cameras
Resources and techniques for using a Physical **Camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) component, which has the same camera settings as most 3D modeling applications.

[Physical Cameras](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PhysicalCameras-introduction.html) | Understand how a Physical Camera component simulates real-word cameras, including settings such as focal length and sensor size.  
[Widen the view with Lens Shift](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PhysicalCameras-LensShift.html) | Offset the camera lens from its sensor horizontally and vertically, to reposition an object in the frame with little or no distortion.  
[Crop or stretch the view with Gate Fit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PhysicalCameras-GateFit-Landing.html) | Resources about using the **Gate Fit** setting to crop, overscan or stretch the camera view.
