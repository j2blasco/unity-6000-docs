[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) size; 
### Description
The total size of the box. This is always twice as large as the [extents](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Bounds-extents.html).
_size.x_ is the width, _size.y_ is the height and _size.z_ is the depth of the box. Note that _size_ is given in world size. A Bound surrounding a tall human might have _size.y_ approximately 2.0f, meaning a 2 meter height body.
