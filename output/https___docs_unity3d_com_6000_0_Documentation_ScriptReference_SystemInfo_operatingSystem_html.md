operatingSystem; 
### Description
Operating system name with version (Read Only).
Returns detailed information about the operating system of the device, including the version. For a simple platform detection, properties like [Application.platform](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-platform.html) or [deviceType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-deviceType.html) might be more appropriate.  
  
**Note:** On Microsoft Store Apps, it's not easy to identify if you're running 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows. However, you can query the CPU architecture to find this information. If the CPU is 64-bit, [SystemInfo.operatingSystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-operatingSystem.html) returns **Windows <version> 64 bit**, and if the CPU is 32-bit - **Windows <version>**.
```
