enable360StereoCapture; 
### Description
Enable 360 Stereo Capture support on the current build target.
When enabled, the standalone player includes shader variants with 360 stereo capture support (currently only on Windows/OSX). The 360 stereo capture shader variants are not included in the standalone player without this flag enabled. Since the additional shader code increases shader compile time and memory, only enable this feature in projects that do 360 stereo capture.
