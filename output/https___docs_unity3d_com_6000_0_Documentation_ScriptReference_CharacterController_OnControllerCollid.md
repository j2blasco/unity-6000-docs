### Description
OnControllerColliderHit is called when the controller hits a collider while performing a Move.
This can be used to push objects when they collide with the character.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // this script pushes all rigidbodies that the character touches
    float pushPower = 2.0f;
    void OnControllerColliderHit(ControllerColliderHit[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ControllerColliderHit.html) hit)
    {
        Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) body = hit.collider.attachedRigidbody;  
  
        // no rigidbody
        if (body == null || body.isKinematic)
        {
            return;
        }  
  
        // We dont want to push objects below us
        if (hit.moveDirection.y < -0.3)
        {
            return;
        }  
  
        // Calculate push direction from move direction,
        // we only push objects to the sides never up and down
        Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) pushDir = new Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html)(hit.moveDirection.x, 0, hit.moveDirection.z);  
  
        // If you know how fast your character is trying to move,
        // then you can also multiply the push velocity by that.  
  
        // Apply the push
        body.velocity = pushDir * pushPower;
    }
}

```
