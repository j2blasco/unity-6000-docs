logWhenShaderIsCompiled; 
### Description
If this is true, a log entry is made each time a shader is compiled at application runtime.
Setting this property allows the application to turn shader compilation logging on or off at application runtime. Each log entry contains the following: shader name, pass name, shader stage and enabled keywords, if any. Note: this option has no effect in release builds.
