Introduction to GameObjects
# Working with GameObjects
The following topics give an overview of how to work with **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) in Unity: 
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
**[Introduction](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GameObjects.html)** | Learn more about GameObjects in Unity.  
**[Unity attributes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/unity-attributes.html)** | An overview of Unity attributes.  
**[Primitive and placeholder objects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PrimitiveObjects.html)** | Information about primitive objects.  
**[Components](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/unity-components.html) A functional part of a GameObject. A GameObject can contain any number of components. Unity has many built-in components, and you can create your own by writing scripts that inherit from MonoBehaviour. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingComponents.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#component)** | An overview of components.  
**[Models](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/models.html) A 3D model representation of an object, such as a character, a building, or a piece of furniture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/3D-formats.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Model)** | An overview of models.  
**[Meshes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/mesh.html)** | Learn more about meshes.  
**[Prefabs](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Prefabs.html) An asset type that allows you to store a GameObject complete with components and properties. The prefab acts as a template from which you can create new object instances in the scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Prefabs.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Prefab)** | Information about prefabs.  
**[Constraints](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Constraints.html) Settings on Joint components which limit movement or rotation. The type and number of constraints vary depending on the type of Joint. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/2d-joints-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Constraints)** | An overview of constraints.
