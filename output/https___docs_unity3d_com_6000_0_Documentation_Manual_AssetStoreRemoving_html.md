# Deprecating your Assets
When you set a package as deprecated, the package no longer displays when you search the **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore). For new customers, itâ€™s removed from the store. However, customers who have already purchased or downloaded the package can still download the package. 
Once you deprecate a package, you need to submit a new draft for review.
To deprecate an Asset:
  1. Open the [Asset Store Publisher](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/) portal and navigate to the **Packages** tab.
  2. Select the **Published** view in the drop-down menu.
