# IL2CPP scripting backend for UWP
IL2CPP is the only [scripting backend](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scripting-backends.html)A framework that powers scripting in Unity. Unity supports three different scripting backends depending on target platform: Mono, .NET and IL2CPP. Universal Windows Platform, however, supports only two: .NET and IL2CPP. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scripting-backends.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#ScriptingBackend) Unity supports to build Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications. When you build a project using **IL2CPP** A Unity-developed scripting back-end which you can use as an alternative to Mono when building projects for some platforms. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scripting-backends-il2cpp.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#IL2CPP), Unity converts the Microsoft Intermediate Language code from your **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts) into C++ before creating a native binary file. For more information on IL2CPP, refer to [IL2CPP overview](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scripting-backends-il2cpp.html).

[Use UWP plug-ins with IL2CPP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/uwp-il2cpp-plugins.html) | Understand how to use managed and native **plug-ins** A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries).
