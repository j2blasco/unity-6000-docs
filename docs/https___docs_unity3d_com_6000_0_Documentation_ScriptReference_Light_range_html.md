range; 
### Description
The range of each point of the light.  
  
Since area lights have a light emitting surface instead of a single point, the cumulative range of the light is larger than this property. This larger range can be read from the [Light.dilatedRange](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Light-dilatedRange.html) property. For non-area lights, Light.range and Light.dilatedRange return the same value.
