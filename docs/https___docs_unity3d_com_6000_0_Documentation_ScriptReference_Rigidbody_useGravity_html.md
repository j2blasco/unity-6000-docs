{
    public Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) coll;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        coll = GetComponent<Collider[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html)>();
        coll.isTrigger = true;
    }  
  
    // Disables gravity on all rigidbodies entering this collider.

    {
        if (other.attachedRigidbody)
