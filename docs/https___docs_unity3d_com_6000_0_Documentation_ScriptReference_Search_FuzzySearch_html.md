### Description
Provides a method to match query text using a fuzzy search algorithm.
This utility class implements the text search functions using approximate string matching (fuzzy search). Search for a text pattern in a given string. If there is a match, get the match score. Get the indices in the string where the pattern was found.  
  
See [FuzzyMatch](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Search.FuzzySearch.FuzzyMatch.html) for a complete example.
