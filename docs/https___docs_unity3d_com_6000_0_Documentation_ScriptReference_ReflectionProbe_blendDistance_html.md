blendDistance; 
### Description
Distance around probe used for blending (used in deferred probes).
When using deferred shading, reflection probes are rendered per-pixel (instead of one or two probes affecting whole object). Blend distance controls how probes blend with each other; essentially it's the size of the probe blend area. Default blend distance is 1.0.
