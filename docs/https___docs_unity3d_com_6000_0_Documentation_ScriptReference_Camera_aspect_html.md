aspect; 
### Description
The aspect ratio (width divided by height).
By default the aspect ratio is automatically calculated from the screen's aspect ratio, even if the camera is not rendering to full area. If you modify the `aspect` ratio of the camera, the value will stay until you call camera.ResetAspect(); which resets the aspect to the screen's aspect ratio.
