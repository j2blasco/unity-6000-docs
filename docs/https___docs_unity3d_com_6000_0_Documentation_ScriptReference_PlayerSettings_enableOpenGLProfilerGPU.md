### Description
Enable [ProfilerRecorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Profiling.ProfilerRecorder.html) usage to record GPU timings when rendering with OpenGL.
Always enabled with other rendering APIs. Optional on OpenGL due to potential incompatibility with the GPU Profiler and, on versions prior to 2022.1, Frame Timing Stats.
