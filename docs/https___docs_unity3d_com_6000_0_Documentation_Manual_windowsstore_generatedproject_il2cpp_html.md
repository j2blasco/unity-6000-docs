# Generate your Visual Studio C++ solution
When you [build a project from Unity for Universal Windows Platform](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/windowsstore-buildsettings.html) (UWP), Unity automatically generates a Visual Studio solution.
## Create your Visual Studio C++ solution
Unity generates a Visual Studio solution containing the following projects:
**Project** | **Description**  
---|---  
**projectName** | Contains your main project code. Visual Studio builds this project into an application package, which you can deploy to a device or uploaded to the Microsoft Store.   
  
**Note:** Unity doesnâ€™t overwrite this project when you build on top of it.  
**Unity Data** | Contains all the Unity-specific files you need to build your project, such as assets.  
**Il2CppOutputProject** | Contains the generated C++ code which Unity converts from managed assemblies.   
  
**Note:** This project is overwritten every time you build over it.  
## Visual Studio build configurations
Unity provides the following [build configuration options in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/understanding-build-configurations):
**Configuration** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Debug** | Use **Debug** to debug your code. This configuration:   
- Disables all optimization.   
- Preserves all debugging information in the code.   
- Results in code that runs slowly.   
- Results in the fastest build time.  
**Release** | Use **Release** to profile your game. This configuration:   
- Enables code optimizations.  
**Master** | Use **Master** for game submission and final testing. This configuration:   
- Disables the profiler.   
- Results in the same build time as the Release configuration.   
- Results in the same build time as the **Release** configuration.  
**MasterWithLTCG** | Use **MasterWithLTCG** for game submission and final testing. This configuration:   
- Enables link time code generation for generated C++ code, IL2CPP runtime, and IL2CPP garbage collection.   
- Results in much longer build times compared to the **Master** configuration.   
- Results in an application that executes faster than the **Master** configuration.
