### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
other | The Collision data associated with this collision.  
### Description
OnCollisionStay is called once per frame for every Collider or Rigidbody that touches another Collider or Rigidbody.
In contrast to OnTriggerStay, OnCollisionStay is passed the [Collision](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html) class and not a [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html). The [Collision](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html) class contains information about contact points, impact velocity etc. If you don't use collisionInfo in the function, leave out the collisionInfo parameter as this avoids unneccessary calculations.  
  
**Note:** Collision events are only sent if one of the colliders also has a non-kinematic rigidbody attached. Collision events will be sent to disabled MonoBehaviours, to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions.  
  
Collision stay events are not sent for sleeping Rigidbodies.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnCollisionStay(Collision[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html) collisionInfo)
    {
        // Debug[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.html)-draw all contact points and normals
        foreach (ContactPoint[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ContactPoint.html) contact in collisionInfo.contacts)
        {
            Debug.DrawRay[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.DrawRay.html)(contact.point, contact.normal, Color.white[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color-white.html));
        }
    }
}

```

OnCollisionStay can be a co-routine, simply use the yield statement in the function.
