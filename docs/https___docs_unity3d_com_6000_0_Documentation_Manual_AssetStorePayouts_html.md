# Collecting revenue
You can receive automated payouts for your **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore) Publisher earnings either monthly (through PayPal) or quarterly (through a bank transfer). You need to set up a payout profile so that Unity knows how you want to get paid, and whether your tax authority requires tax withholding on revenue.
**Note** : The Unity Asset Store currently only supports payouts in USD.

  2. Go to the [Asset Store Publisher](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/info.html) portal. 
  3. Open the **Payout** tab. The following message appears:
