SpeedTree model import
# Import trees from SpeedTree
[SpeedTree](https://store.speedtree.com/) provides prebuilt tree assets and modeling software focused specifically on trees. SpeedTree supports all **render pipelines** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).
