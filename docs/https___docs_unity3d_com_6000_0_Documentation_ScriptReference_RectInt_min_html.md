[Vector2Int](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2Int.html) min; 
### Description
The lower left corner of the rectangle; which is the minimal position of the rectangle along the x- and y-axes, when it is aligned to both axes.
If you enter a minimum value that is greater than the current maximum value, then the entered value becomes the new maximum value and the previous maximum value becomes the new minimum value. The position and size of the [RectInt](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectInt.html) is then adjusted based on the new minimum and maximum values.
