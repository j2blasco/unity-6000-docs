### Description
Add this function to a subclass to get a notification when a new Material is created during an import of a ModelImporter.
Use this method to modify the properties of newly created Material assets during import.  
  
Note: This method is only called by the ModelImporter when the ModelImporter.MaterialImportMode option is set to [ModelImporterMaterialImportMode.ImportStandard](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporterMaterialImportMode.ImportStandard.html).
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);  
  
public class MakeMaterialsRed : AssetPostprocessor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.html)
{
    void OnPostprocessMaterial(Material[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html) material)
    {
        material.color = Color.red[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color-red.html);
    }
}

```
