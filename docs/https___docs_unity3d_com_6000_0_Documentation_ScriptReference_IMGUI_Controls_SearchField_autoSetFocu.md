autoSetFocusOnFindCommand; 
### Description
Changes the keyboard focus to the search field when the user presses ‘Ctrl/Cmd + F’ when set to true. It is true by default.
An ExecuteCommand event is dispatched when a user presses ‘Ctrl/Cmd + F’. The search field automatically handles this event and sets the keyboard focus on the text field. This behavior can be disabled by setting autoSetFocusOnFindCommand to false. It is true by default.
