# Introduction to build types
Unity produces two build types:
  * A **release** build, which includes only whatâ€™s necessary to run the application. This is the default build type.
  * A **development** build, which includes scripting debug symbols and the **profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Profiler). Select the **development build** A development build includes debug symbols and enables the Profiler. [More info](https://docs.unity.com/devops/en/manual/build-target-configurations#Build_target_advanced_settings_overview)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#DevelopmentBuild) option to enable an additional set of options, such as deep profiling support and script debugging.


For faster iteration during development, Unity uses an incremental build pipeline that rebuilds artifacts only if they have changed since the previous build. For more information, refer to [Incremental build pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/incremental-build-pipeline.html).
