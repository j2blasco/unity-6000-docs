### Description
Stores lightmaps of the Scene.
A Scene can have several lightmaps stored in it, and [Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer.html) components can use those lightmaps. This makes it possible to use the same material on multiple objects, while each object can refer to a different lightmap or different portion of the same lightmap.
