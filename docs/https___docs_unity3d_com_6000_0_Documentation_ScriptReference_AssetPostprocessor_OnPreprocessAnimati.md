### Description
Add this function to a subclass to get a notification just before animation from a model (.fbx, .mb file etc.) is imported.
This lets you control the import settings through code.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);  
  
public class Example : AssetPostprocessor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.html)
{
    void OnPreprocessAnimation()
    {
        ModelImporter[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporter.html) modelImporter = assetImporter as ModelImporter[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporter.html);
        modelImporter.clipAnimations = modelImporter.defaultClipAnimations;
    }
}

```
