### Description
Base class for Texture handling.
### Static Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[allowThreadedTextureCreation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-allowThreadedTextureCreation.html) | Allow Unity internals to perform Texture creation on any thread (rather than the dedicated render thread).  
[currentTextureMemory](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-currentTextureMemory.html) | The amount of memory that all Textures in the scene use.  
[desiredTextureMemory](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-desiredTextureMemory.html) | The total size of the Textures, in bytes, that Unity loads if there were no other constraints. Before Unity loads any Textures, it applies the memory budget which reduces the loaded Texture resolution if the Texture sizes exceed its value. The desiredTextureMemory value takes into account the mipmap levels that Unity has requested or that you have set manually.For example, if Unity does not load a Texture at full resolution because it is far away or its requested mipmap level is greater than 0, Unity reduces the desiredTextureMemory value to match the total memory needed.The desiredTextureMemory value can be greater than the Texture.targetTextureMemory value.   
[GenerateAllMips](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.GenerateAllMips.html) | Can be used with Texture constructors that take a mip count to indicate that all mips should be generated. The value of this field is -1.  
[nonStreamingTextureCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-nonStreamingTextureCount.html) | The number of non-streaming Textures in the scene. This includes instances of Texture2D and CubeMap Textures. This does not include any other Texture types, or 2D and CubeMap Textures that Unity creates internally.  
[nonStreamingTextureMemory](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-nonStreamingTextureMemory.html) | The amount of memory Unity allocates for non-streaming Textures in the scene. This only includes instances of Texture2D and CubeMap Textures. This does not include any other Texture types, or 2D and CubeMap Textures that Unity creates internally.  
[streamingMipmapUploadCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-streamingMipmapUploadCount.html) | How many times has a Texture been uploaded due to Texture mipmap streaming.  
[streamingRendererCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-streamingRendererCount.html) | Number of renderers registered with the Texture streaming system.  
[streamingTextureCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-streamingTextureCount.html) | Number of streaming Textures.  
[streamingTextureDiscardUnusedMips](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-streamingTextureDiscardUnusedMips.html) | This property forces the streaming Texture system to discard all unused mipmaps instead of caching them until the Texture memory budget is exceeded. This is useful when you profile or write tests to keep a predictable set of Textures in memory.  
[streamingTextureForceLoadAll](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-streamingTextureForceLoadAll.html) | Force streaming Textures to load all mipmap levels.  
[streamingTextureLoadingCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-streamingTextureLoadingCount.html) | Number of streaming Textures with mipmaps currently loading.  
[streamingTexturePendingLoadCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-streamingTexturePendingLoadCount.html) | Number of streaming Textures with outstanding mipmaps to be loaded.  
[targetTextureMemory](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-targetTextureMemory.html) | The total amount of Texture memory that Unity allocates to the Textures in the scene after it applies the memory budget and finishes loading Textures. `targetTextureMemory`also takes mipmap streaming settings into account. This value only includes instances of Texture2D and CubeMap Textures. This value does not include any other Texture types, or 2D and CubeMap Textures that Unity creates internally.  
[totalTextureMemory](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-totalTextureMemory.html) | The total amount of Texture memory that Unity would use if it loads all Textures at mipmap level 0.This is a theoretical value that does not take into account any input from the streaming system or any other input, for example when you set the`Texture2D.requestedMipmapLevel` manually.To see a Texture memory value that takes inputs into account, use `desiredTextureMemory`.`totalTextureMemory` only includes instances of Texture2D and CubeMap Textures. This value does not include any other Texture types, or 2D and CubeMap Textures that Unity creates internally.
