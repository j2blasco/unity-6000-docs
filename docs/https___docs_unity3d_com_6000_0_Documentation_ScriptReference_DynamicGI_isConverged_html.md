### Description
Is precomputed Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination output converged?
The GI system will process updates to lighting and update the Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination lightmaps. Updates can be triggered by Scene load, animating lights and material changes. Can for instance be used to show a loading screen while lighting is still converging and remove the loading screen once lighting is fully converged.
