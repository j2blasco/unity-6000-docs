Introduction to shaders
# Shaders
Resources for using or writing programs that run on the GPU to control the appearance of objects in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene).

[Introduction to shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-introduction.html) | Understand the different types of **shader** , and key terminology.  
[Built-in shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-built-in-landing.html) | Resources for the shaders Unity provides. Use built-in shaders to create a wide range of materials, from simple unlit colors to physically-based lit surfaces.  
[Writing custom shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/writing-custom-shaders.html) | Resources for creating your own shaders using Shader Graph, or High-Level Shader Language (HLSL) and **ShaderLab** Unityâ€™s language for defining the structure of Shader objects. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SL-Shader.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#ShaderLab).  
[Optimize shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SL-ShaderPerformance.html) | Optimizing custom shaders for runtime performance, especially on mobile platforms that have limited GPU performance.  
[Shaders in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/shaders-in-universalrp.html) | Resources for using or writing shaders in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).  
[Shaders in the Built-In Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-built-in-birp-landing.html) | Resources for using shaders in the Built-In Render Pipeline to create materials for real-world objects or particles.  
[Troubleshooting shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-troubleshooting.html) | Solve common issues with shaders, such as hitches and stalls, or large build sizes.  
[Shader languages reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shaders-reference.html) | Reference for ShaderLab, and High Level Shader Language (HLSL) in Unity.
