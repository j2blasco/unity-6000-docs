## Declaration
public void RefreshPrototypes(); 
### Description
Reloads all the values of the available prototypes (ie, detail mesh assets) in the TerrainData Object.
This can be used in editor scripts to update the terrain when the prototype assets change, much like the Terrain > Refresh Tree and Detail Prototypes menu command.
