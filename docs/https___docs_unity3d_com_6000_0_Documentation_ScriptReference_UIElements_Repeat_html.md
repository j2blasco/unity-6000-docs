### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[NoRepeat](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Repeat.NoRepeat.html) |  The background-image isn't repeated. The image is only shown once. This is the default to keep background compatibility with unity-background-scale-mode.   
[Space](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Repeat.Space.html) |  The background-image is repeated as much as possible without clipping. The first and last image is pinned to either side of the element, and whitespace is distributed evenly between the images.   
[Round](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Repeat.Round.html) |  The background-image is repeated and squished or stretched to fill the space (no gaps).   
[Repeat](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Repeat.Repeat.html) |  The background image is repeated both vertically and horizontally. The last image will be clipped if it doesn't fit.
