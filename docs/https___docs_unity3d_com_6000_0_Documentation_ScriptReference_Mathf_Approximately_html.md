## Declaration
public static bool Approximately(float a, float b); 
### Description
Compares two floating point values and returns true if they are similar.
Floating point imprecision makes comparing floats using the equals operator inaccurate. For example, `(1.0 == 10.0 / 10.0)` might not return true every time. Approximately() compares two floats and returns true if they are within a small value ([Epsilon](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mathf.Epsilon.html)) of each other.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class ScriptExample : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        if (Mathf.Approximately[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mathf.Approximately.html)(1.0f, 10.0f / 10.0f))
        {
            print("The values are approximately the same");
        }
    }
}
