Introduction to scenes
# Working with scenes
Scenes are where you work with content in Unity. Read the following information to find out more about **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene).

This includes camera rendering, lighting, physics collisions, or custom calculations in your own code. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Layers.html)

A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)

**[Tags](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Tags.html) A reference word which you can assign to one or more GameObjects to help you identify GameObjects for scripting purposes. For example, you might define and “Edible” Tag for any item the player can eat in your game. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Tags.html)
