using System[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.VirtualTexturing.System.html);
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Scripting;  
  
public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        IFoo ifoo = new Foo();
    }
}  
  
[RequireImplementors]
interface IFoo {}  
  
class Foo : IFoo {}  
  
// UnusedFoo is not used, however, it will survive managed code stripping due to IFoo having the [RequireImplementors] attribute.
class UnusedFoo : IFoo
{
    // Note that unused members of UnusedFoo will still be removed by managed code stripping
    public static void UnusedMethod() {}
}  
  
// IBar is not used so it will be removed by managed code stripping
[RequireImplementors]
interface IBar {}  
  
// Because IBar is not used, the [RequireImplementors] attribute on IBar has no impact.  UnusedBar will also be removed.
class UnusedBar : IBar {}
