### Description
An interface that represents a job that performs the same independent operation for each element of a native container or for a fixed number of iterations.
This job type has the following options to schedule work: 
  * [IJobForExtensions.Run](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.IJobForExtensions.Run.html) runs the job on the main thread and finishes immediately.
  * [IJobForExtensions.Schedule](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.IJobForExtensions.Schedule.html) schedules the job to run on a worker thread or the main thread, but indicates that the work should happen in a single thread. This option allows for work to be done off the main thread, but the work is performed sequentially.
  * [IJobForExtensions.ScheduleParallel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.IJobForExtensions.ScheduleParallel.html) schedules the job to run on multiple worker threads concurrently. This scheduling option can give the best performance, but conflicts might happen when accessing the same data from multiple worker threads simultaneously.
  * `Execute(int index)` is executed once for each index from 0 to the provided length.


`Run` and `Schedule` guarantees that the the job's `Execute(int index)` method is invoked sequentially. `ScheduleParallel` doesn't invoke the job's `Execute` method sequentially because it's called from multiple worker threads in parallel to each other.  
  
Each iteration must be independent from other iterations and the safety system enforces this rule for you. The indices have no guaranteed order and are executed on multiple cores in parallel.   
  
Unity automatically splits the work into chunks of no less than the provided `batchSize`, and schedules an appropriate number of jobs based on the number of worker threads, the length of the array and the batch size. You should choose the batch size based on the amount of work performed in the job. A simple job, for example adding a couple of Vector3 to each other should have a batch size of 32 to 128. However, if the work performed is very expensive then it's best practice to use a small batch size, for example, a batch size of 1. IJobFor performs work stealing using atomic operations. Batch sizes can be small but they are not for free.  
  
You can use the returned `JobHandle` to check that the job has completed, or pass it to other jobs as a dependency. When you pass a `JobHandle` as a dependency, it ensures that the jobs are executed one after another on the worker threads.
