## Declaration
public static void CaptureNextFrameToXcode(); 
### Description
Begin capture to Xcode at the beginning of the next frame, and end it at the end of the next frame.
This is the same as calling [FrameCapture.BeginCaptureToXcode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Apple.FrameCapture.BeginCaptureToXcode.html) and [FrameCapture.EndCapture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Apple.FrameCapture.EndCapture.html), but with implicit boundaries at the start and end of the frame.
