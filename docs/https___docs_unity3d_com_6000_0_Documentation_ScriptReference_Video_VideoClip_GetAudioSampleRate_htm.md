## Declaration
public uint GetAudioSampleRate(ushort audioTrackIdx); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
audioTrackIdx | Index of the audio queried audio track.  
### Returns
**uint** The sampling rate in hertz. 
### Description
Get the audio track sampling rate in hertz (Hz).
The audio sampling rate is the number of times per second a sample of audio is captured. Higher sample rates usually result in more realistic sounds and better sound quality, but files are larger. This is useful to know so that you can cater your audio to different devices. A VideoClip could have multiple audio tracks for different quality levels, which you can change depending on the device.
