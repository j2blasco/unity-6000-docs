## Declaration
public static [Vector2Int](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2Int.html) CeilToInt([Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) v); 
### Description
Converts a [Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) to a [Vector2Int](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2Int.html) by doing a Ceiling to each value.
As there is a conversion of float to integer, there is a loss of precision.
