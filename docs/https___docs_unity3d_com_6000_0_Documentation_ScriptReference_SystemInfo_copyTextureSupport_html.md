[Rendering.CopyTextureSupport](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CopyTextureSupport.html) copyTextureSupport; 
### Description
Support for various [Graphics.CopyTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.CopyTexture.html) cases (Read Only).
Most modern platforms and graphics APIs support quite flexible texture copy (e.g. copy from a [RenderTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html) into a [Cubemap](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Cubemap.html) face). However some older systems might not support certain parts of texture copy functionality. [CopyTextureSupport](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CopyTextureSupport.html) flags indicate this.
