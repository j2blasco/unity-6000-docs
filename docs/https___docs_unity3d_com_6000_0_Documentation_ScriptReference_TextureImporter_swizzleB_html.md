### Description
Specifies the source for the texture's blue color channel data.
By default, values for the imported texture's blue channel come from the source image's blue channel. To reorder or invert color channels at import time, change this to another value of [TextureImporterSwizzle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporterSwizzle.html).
