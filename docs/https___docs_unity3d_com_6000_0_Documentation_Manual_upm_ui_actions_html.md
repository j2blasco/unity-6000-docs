# Add and remove UPM packages or feature sets
You can perform a variety of package management tasks by using the Package Manager window.
Follow these tasks to manage **UPM packages** A **Package** managed by the **Unity Package Manager**. Refer to **Packages**.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#UPMpackage) or **feature sets** A feature set is a collection of related packages that you can use to achieve specific results in the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in Unity’s Package Manager. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Featureset). For information about managing **asset packages** A collection of files and data from Unity projects, or elements of projects, which are compressed and stored in one file, similar to Zip files, with the `.unitypackage` extension. Asset packages are a handy way of sharing and re-using Unity projects and collections of assets. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetPackages.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Assetpackage), refer to [Add and remove asset packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-actions-ap.html).

The procedures described in these sections obscure a lot of the details of what the Package Manager is actually doing behind the scenes. The Package Manager window provides a visual interface to install and uninstall packages. The Package Manager installs and uninstalls packages by adding and removing packages as project dependencies in your [project’s manifest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html). When it adds a package, it selects the correct version to install. The version that Package Manager selects doesn’t always match the version you indicated. For more information, refer to [Package dependency and resolution](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-dependencies.html).
