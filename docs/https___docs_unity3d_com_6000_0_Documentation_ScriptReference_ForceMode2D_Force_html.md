### Description
Add a force to the Rigidbody2D, using its mass.
Apply the force in each FixedUpdate over a duration of time. This mode depends on the mass of rigidbody so more force must be applied to move higher-mass objects the same amount as lower-mass objects.  
  
This mode is useful for setting up realistic physics where it takes more force to move heavier objects.
