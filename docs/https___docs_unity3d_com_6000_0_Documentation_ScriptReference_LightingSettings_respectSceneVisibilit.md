respectSceneVisibilityWhenBakingGI; 
### Description
When Unity is precomputing or baking Global Illumination, respect the Scene Visibility setting of a [[GameObject] with a [MeshRenderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MeshRenderer.html) or [Terrain](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Terrain.html) component.
This property requires that a [SceneView](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneView.html) be present in the editor for it to have any effect; this includes while in [batch mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-isBatchMode.html). See [EditorWindow](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorWindow.html) and [SceneVisibilityManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneVisibilityManager.html) for more information.
