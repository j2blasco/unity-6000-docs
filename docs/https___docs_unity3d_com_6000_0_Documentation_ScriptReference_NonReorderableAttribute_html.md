### Description
Disables reordering of an array or list in the Inspector window.
By default, array or list script variables are presented with a UI control that allows array element reordering via drag handles to the left of element content. You can use [NonReorderable] attribute on a script array or list variable to disable this. When reordering is disabled, the Inspector shows arrays or lists with a simple UI control that has an array size followed by array elements.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class NonReorderableAttributeTest : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    [NonReorderable]
    public int[] array;
}

```
