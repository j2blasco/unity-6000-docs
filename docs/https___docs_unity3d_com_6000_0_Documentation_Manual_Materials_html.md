Introduction to materials
# Materials
In Unity, you use materials and **shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) together to define the appearance of your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene).
**Page** | **Description**

[Introduction to materials](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/materials-introduction.html) | Understand using materials to describe the appearance of surfaces.  
[Create and assign a material](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/create-material.html) | Create a material asset, and assign it to a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject).  
[Upgrade material assets to URP or HDRP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upgrade-material.html) | Upgrade your Built-In **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) materials to prevent them from appearing bright pink in **Scene view** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SceneView).  
[Access material properties in a script](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/MaterialsAccessingViaScript.html) | Modify values on a material, change colours, and swap textures at runtime.  
[Material Variants](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/materialvariant-landingpage.html) | Resources on managing and maintaining large numbers of materials.  
[Material Validator in the Built-in Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/materials-troubleshooting.html) | Resources on using the Material Validator in the Built-In Render Pipeline to check and fix values in materials that are too large or small.  
[Material Inspector window reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Material.html) | Explore the properties and settings in the Material **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector) window to change how a material looks.
