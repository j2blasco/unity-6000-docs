## Declaration
public void SetMinMax([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) min, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) max); 
### Description
Sets the bounds to the `min` and `max` value of the box.
Using this function is faster than assigning `min` and `max` separately.
