[Video.VideoSource](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoSource.html) source; 
### Description
The source that the [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) uses for playback.
It is valid to set both a [VideoClip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoClip.html) and a URL in the [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html). This property controls which one will get used for playback. When setting a new clip or URL, the source will automatically change to make the associated type current.  
  
**Note:** On WebGL, only [VideoSource.Url](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoSource.Url.html) is supported.
