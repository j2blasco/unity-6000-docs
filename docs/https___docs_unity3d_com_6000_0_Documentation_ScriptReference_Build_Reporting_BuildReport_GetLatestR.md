### Description
Return the build report generated by the most recent Player or AssetBundle build
A BuildReport is generated when a Player build runs, or when [BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles.html) is called. The BuildReport is automatically saved to **Library/LastBuild.buildreport** and can be reloaded using this static method.
