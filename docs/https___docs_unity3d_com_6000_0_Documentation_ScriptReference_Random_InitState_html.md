## Declaration
public static void InitState(int seed); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
seed | Seed used to initialize the random number generator.  
### Description
Initializes the random number generator state with a seed.
The random number generator is not truly random, but produces numbers in a preset sequence (the values in the sequence "jump" around the range in such a way that they appear random for most purposes).  
  
The point in the sequence where a particular run of pseudo-random values begins is selected using an integer called the _seed_ value. This prevents the same run of values from occurring each time a game is played and thus avoids predictable gameplay. It is sometimes useful to produce the same run of pseudo-random values on demand by setting the seed yourself.  
  
You might set your own seed, for example, when you generate a game level procedurally. You can use randomly-chosen elements to make the Scene look arbitrary and natural but set the seed to a preset value before generating. This will make sure that the same "random" pattern is produced each time the game is played. This can often be an effective way to reduce a game's storage requirements - you can generate as many levels as you like procedurally and store each one using nothing more than an integer seed value.  
  
The seed is randomly initialized at startup (see [Random](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random.html) for more information on this) but if you want to randomize it later on, you can use `Random.InitState((int)DateTime.Now.Ticks)`.  
  
The seed cannot be retrieved once set - the pseudorandomization algorithm stores its internal state in a more complex set of numbers. However, this state can be loaded and stored via the [state](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random-state.html) property, which works with the opaque but serializable [State](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random.State.html). 
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    private float[] noiseValues;
    void Start()
    {
        Random.InitState[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random.InitState.html)(42);
        noiseValues = new float[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < noiseValues.Length; i++)
        {
            noiseValues[i] = Random.value[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random-value.html);
            Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)(noiseValues[i]);
        }
    }
}
