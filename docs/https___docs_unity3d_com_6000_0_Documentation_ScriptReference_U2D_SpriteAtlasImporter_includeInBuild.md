### Description
Property to get/set whether this Sprite Atlas is marked to be included in the build.
Include this method to ensure that the Sprite refers to the Sprite Atlas's packed Texture at runtime. Conversely, the packed texture will not be in the build. It can be late bound to the sprite at runtime.
