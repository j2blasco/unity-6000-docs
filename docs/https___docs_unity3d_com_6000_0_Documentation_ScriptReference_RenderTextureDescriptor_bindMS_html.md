### Description
If true and [msaaSamples](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureDescriptor-msaaSamples.html) is greater than 1, the render texture will not be resolved by default. Use this if the render texture needs to be bound as a multisampled texture in a shader.
