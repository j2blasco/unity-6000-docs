## Declaration
public static bool ComputePenetration([Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) colliderA, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) positionA, [Quaternion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) rotationA, [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) colliderB, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) positionB, [Quaternion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) rotationB, out [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) direction, out float distance); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
colliderA | The first collider.  
positionA | Position of the first collider.  
rotationA | Rotation of the first collider.  
colliderB | The second collider.  
positionB | Position of the second collider.  
rotationB | Rotation of the second collider.  
direction | Direction along which the translation required to separate the colliders apart is minimal.  
distance | The distance along direction that is required to separate the colliders apart.  
### Returns
**bool** True, if the colliders overlap at the given poses. 
### Description
Compute the minimal translation required to separate the given colliders apart at specified poses.
Translating the first collider by direction * distance will separate the colliders apart if the function returned true. Otherwise, direction and distance are not defined.  
  
One of the colliders has to be BoxCollider, SphereCollider CapsuleCollider or a convex MeshCollider. The other one can be any type.  
  
Note that you aren't restricted to the position and rotation the colliders have at the moment of the call. Passing position or rotation that is different from the currently set one doesn't have an effect of physically moving any colliders thus has no side effects on the Scene.  
  
Doesn't depend on any spatial structures to be updated first, so is not bound to be used only within FixedUpdate timeframe.  
  
Ignores backfaced triangles and doesn't respect [Physics.queriesHitBackfaces](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics-queriesHitBackfaces.html).  
  
This function is useful to write custom depenetration functions. One particular example is an implementation of a character controller where a specific reaction to collision with the surrounding physics objects is required. In this case, one would first query for the colliders nearby using OverlapSphere and then adjust the character's position using the data returned by ComputePenetration.
