## Declaration
public static void RegisterCreatedObjectUndo([Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Object.html) objectToUndo, string name); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
objectToUndo | The newly created object. This object is destroyed when the undo operation is performed. When the value is a GameObject, Unity registers the GameObject and its child GameObjects, but not sibling or parent GameObjects.  
name | The name of the action to undo. Use this string to provide a short description of the action to be undone. For **Undo** or **Redo** items in the **Edit** menu, Unity adds "Undo" or "Redo" to the string that you provide. For example, if you provide the string "Create GameObject", the Unity Editor displays the menu item **Edit** > **Undo Create GameObject**.  
### Description
Registers an undo operation to undo the creation of an object.
This method registers the creation of an object to the undo stack so that users can undo a create object action. Use this method each time you define an action that creates an object, for example, inside a custom Editor or menu item. Unity updates the undo action in the **Edit** menu with the name of the undo operation. When the user performs the undo action, Unity destroys the object.  
  
**Note:** The undo process destroys objects in the same way as [Object.Destroy](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Object.Destroy.html), but with no delay.  
  
When you create and modify an object at the same time, use the following workflow to ensure that [Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo.html) saves all updates to the object: 
  1. Create the object.
  2. Register the object as created with `Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo`.
  3. Register the object with [Undo.RegisterCompleteObjectUndo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.RegisterCompleteObjectUndo.html) so that the Editor records changes to the object. If the object has any child GameObjects, register it with [Undo.RegisterFullObjectHierarchyUndo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.RegisterFullObjectHierarchyUndo.html) instead.
  4. Update the object.


If you do not follow this workflow, `Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo` might not save any updates to the object other than object creation.  
  
When you register a new object with `Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo`, Unity registers any changes to objects that are currently recorded by [Undo.RecordObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.RecordObject.html) and then stops recording. This means that after you register a new object, Unity does not record any subsequent changes to any other objects that `Undo.RecordObject` was already recording.  
  
When Unity is already recording changes to existing objects with `Undo.RecordObject` and you want to register newly created objects, it is best practice to follow this workflow: 
  1. Complete any changes you want to make to objects that `Undo.RecordObject` is recording. Unity calls [Undo.FlushUndoRecordObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.FlushUndoRecordObjects.html) automatically.
  2. Register newly created objects with `Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo`.


If you do not follow this workflow, Unity might not store the state of the recorded objects on the undo stack correctly.  
  
The following example shows how to create and modify a GameObject with a child as an operation that can be undone in a single undo step.
