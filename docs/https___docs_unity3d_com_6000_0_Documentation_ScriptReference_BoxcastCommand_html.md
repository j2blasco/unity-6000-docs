### Description
Use this struct to set up a box cast command to be performed asynchronously during a job.
When you use this struct to schedule a batch of box casts, the box casts will are performed asynchronously and in parallel. The results of each box cast is written to the results buffer. Since the results are written asynchronously, you cannot accesss the results buffer until the job is completed.  
  
The results for a command at index N in the command buffer are stored at index N * maxHits in the results buffer.  
  
Boxcast command also allows you to control whether or not Trigger colliders and back-face triangles generate a hit. Use [QueryParameters](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QueryParameters.html) to control hit flags.  
  
Note: Only BatchQuery.ExecuteBoxcastJob is logged into the profiler. Query count information is not logged.
