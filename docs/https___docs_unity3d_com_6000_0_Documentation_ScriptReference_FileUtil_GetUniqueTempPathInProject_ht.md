## Declaration
public static string GetUniqueTempPathInProject(); 
### Description
Returns a unique path in the Temp folder within your current project.
The returned path is relative to the project folder.  
  
The returned path is of a form `Temp/UnityTempFile-`_uniqueID_ , where `uniqueID` is guaranteed to be unique over space and time.  
  
You can use it to create temporary files/folders and be sure that you are not overriding somebody else's files, plus you don't have to keep track of the unique IDs yourself.  
  

```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);  
  
public class GetUniqueTempPath : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    [MenuItem[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MenuItem.html)("Example/Get Unique Temp Path")]
    static void GetUniqueTempPathInProject()
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)(FileUtil.GetUniqueTempPathInProject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FileUtil.GetUniqueTempPathInProject.html)());
