basemapDistance; 
### Description
Heightmap patches beyond basemap distance will use a precomputed low res basemap.
This improves performance for far away patches. Close up Unity renders the heightmap using splat maps by blending between any amount of provided terrain textures.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Terrain.activeTerrain.basemapDistance = 100;
    }
}

```
