### Description
Determines whether or not mipmaps are automatically generated when the RenderTexture is modified. This flag is set by default, and has no effect if the [RenderTextureCreationFlags.MipMap](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureCreationFlags.MipMap.html) flag is not also set. See [RenderTexture.autoGenerateMips](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-autoGenerateMips.html) for more details.
