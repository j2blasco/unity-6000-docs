isDebugBuild; 
### Description
In the Build Settings dialog there is a check box called "Development Build".
If it is checked isDebugBuild will be true. In the editor `isDebugBuild` always returns true. It is recommended to remove all calls to [Debug.Log](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html) when deploying a game, this way you can easily deploy beta builds with debug prints and final builds without.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Log some debug information only if this is a debug build
        if (Debug.isDebugBuild[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug-isDebugBuild.html))
        {
            Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("This is a debug build!");
        }
    }
}
