### Description
[OnMouseDown](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseDown.html) is called when the user presses the left mouse button while over the [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html).
This event is sent to all scripts of the GameObject with [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html). Scripts of the parent or child objects do not receive this event.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnMouseDown()
    {
        // Destroy the gameObject after clicking on it
        Destroy(gameObject);
    }
}

```
