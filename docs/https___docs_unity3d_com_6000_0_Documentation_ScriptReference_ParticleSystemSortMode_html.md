### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[None](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSortMode.None.html) | No sorting.  
[Distance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSortMode.Distance.html) | Sort based on distance to the camera position. For orthographic cameras, this mode is the same as sorting by depth.  
[OldestInFront](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSortMode.OldestInFront.html) | Sort the oldest particles to the front.  
[YoungestInFront](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSortMode.YoungestInFront.html) | Sort the youngest particles to the front.  
[Depth](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSortMode.Depth.html) | Sort based on depth from the camera plane.  
[DistanceReverse](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSortMode.DistanceReverse.html) | Sort based on reverse distance to the camera position. For orthographic cameras, this mode is the same as sorting by depth.  
[DepthReverse](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemSortMode.DepthReverse.html) | Sort based on reverse depth from the camera plane.
