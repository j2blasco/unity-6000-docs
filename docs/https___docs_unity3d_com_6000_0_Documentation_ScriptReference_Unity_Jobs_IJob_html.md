### Description
An interface that allows you to schedule a single job that runs in parallel to other jobs and the main thread.
After a job is scheduled, the job's Execute method is invoked on a worker thread. You can use the returned [JobHandle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html) to make sure that the job has completed. You can also pass the JobHandle to other jobs as a dependency, which ensures that jobs are executed one after another on the worker threads.
