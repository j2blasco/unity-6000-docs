### Description
Target texture of currently rendering camera.
This is the render target where the current camera would be ultimately rendering into. The render target that is active right now might be different (e.g. during light shadow map rendering, or right after another [CommandBuffer.Blit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CommandBuffer.Blit.html) etc.).  
  
Additional resources: [CommandBuffer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CommandBuffer.html).
