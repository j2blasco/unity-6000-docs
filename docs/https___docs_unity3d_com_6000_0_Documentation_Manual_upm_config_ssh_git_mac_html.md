# Load SSH keys automatically on macOS
If you use macOS, follow these steps to configure the OpenSSH client so you can use your passphrase-protected SSH key without prompts.
## Prerequisites
  * macOS 10.13 or later.


## Before you begin
Check if you have any existing SSH keys. Refer to the GitHub Docs article, [Checking for existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys).
If you don’t have an SSH key:
  1. Create one by following the GitHub Docs article, [Generating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
  2. Add the new SSH key to your GitHub account, by following the GitHub Docs article, [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).


## Procedure
  1. Check your home folder for an `.ssh` subdirectory and check if it contains a `config` file. **Note** : `.ssh` is a hidden subdirectory.
  2. Create the `~/.ssh/config` file if it doesn’t exist.
  3. Add the following content to `~/.ssh/config` to set the key to load in the authentication agent and specify its use by the target server. Make sure you add this entry before any global settings marked as `Host *`.
```
Host SERVER_NAME
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile FILE_PATH        

```

     * `SERVER_NAME` is the server that uses the file specified by `IdentityFile`. A sample value is `github.com`.
     * `FILE_PATH` is the path to the SSH file you created. A sample value is `~/.ssh/<FILE>`, where `<FILE>` might be `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, or a custom name.
Example:
```
Host github.com
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

```

  4. Open the Terminal application.
  5. Load your key file into the `ssh-agent`, replacing `<FILE>` with the actual file name of your key, then type your passphrase, if prompted.
```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/<FILE>

```

Example:
```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

```



Configuration is complete. macOS starts `ssh-agent` by default, so you can now use the Unity Package Manager to fetch packages from that Git repository over SSH using your passphrase-protected SSH key.
