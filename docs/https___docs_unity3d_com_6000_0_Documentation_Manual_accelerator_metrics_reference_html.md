# Unity Accelerator Prometheus metrics reference
Each Unity **Accelerator** The Unity Accelerator is an external tool that provides an asset cache that keeps copies of a team’s imported assets. The goal of the Accelerator is to speed up teamwork and reduce iteration time by coordinating asset sharing so that you don’t need to reimport portions of your project. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UnityAccelerator.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Accelerator) hosts [Prometheus metric reports](https://prometheus.io/) as `/metrics`, which you can query from the local network. The following is a full list of metrics that you can access:
**Metric** | **Description**  
---|---  
`process_resident_memory_bytes` | The amount of memory used by the cache server.  
`uta_agent_sys_cpu_percent` | The amount of CPU used by the system.  
`uta_agent_sys_mem_bytes_used` | The amount of memory used by the system.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_connects` | The number of times Unity Editors have connected to the service for the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_bytes_in` | The number of bytes received from the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_bytes_out` | The number of bytes sent to the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="0",method="get"}` | The number of items sent to the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="1",method="get"}` | The number of errors occurring from items sent to the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="2",method="get"}` | The number of namespace errors occurring from items sent to the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="3",method="get"}` | The number of requests made from the Asset Import Pipeline for items that have not been cached.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="0",method="put"}` | The number of items received from the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="1",method="put"}` | The number of errors occurring from items received from the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="2",method="put"}` | The number of namespace errors occurring from items received from the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="0",method="delete"}` | The number of requests made from Asset Import Pipeline to remove items.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="1",method="delete"}` | The number of errors occurring from the Asset Import Pipeline removing items.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="2",method="delete"}` | The number of namespace errors occurring from requests to remove items by the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_requests{code="3",method="delete"}` | The number of requests to remove items made from the Asset Import Pipeline for items that haven’t been cached.  
`uta_agent_cache_bytes_evicted_unscheduled` | Number of bytes evicted from cache during an unscheduled pass. Unscheduled evictions occur when running out of disk space while processing a request. Normally, scheduled background evictions should keep up with demand, so an increase in this metric’s value indicates an overwhelmed server. Increasing the configuration’s `CacheMinFreeBytes` or `CacheMinFreePercent` might help give more free space, or you might need to upgrade the underlying hardware or install an additional Unity Accelerator instance.  
`uta_agent_cache_files_evicted_unscheduled` | Similar to the previous `uta_agent_cache_bytes_evicted_unscheduled` metrics, but counts files evicted instead of byte count. This might be an easier metric to alert on. For example: Alert when files metric increases by more than 1 per second.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_cache_hits` | Number of Asset Import Pipeline requests that were served from cache.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_cache_misses` | Number of Asset Import Pipeline requests that couldn’t be served from cache.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_cache_bytes_out` | Number of bytes served from cache to the Asset Import Pipeline.  
`uta_agent_protobuf_cache_bytes_in` | Number of bytes stored into the cache received from the Asset Import Pipeline.
