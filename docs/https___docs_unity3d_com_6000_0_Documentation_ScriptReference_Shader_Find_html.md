## Declaration
public static [Shader](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Shader.html) Find(string name); 
### Description
Finds a shader with the given `name`. Returns `null` if the shader is not found.
Shader.Find can be used to switch to another shader without having to keep a reference to the shader. `name` is the name you can see in the shader popup of any material, for example "Standard", "Unlit/Texture", "Legacy Shaders/Diffuse" etc.  
  
Note that a shader might be not included into the player build if nothing references it. In that case, Shader.Find will work only in the Editor, and will result in the pink [error shader](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-error.html) in a build. Because of that, it is advisable to use shader references instead of finding them by name. To make sure a shader is included into the game build, do either of: 1) reference it from some of the materials used in your Scene, 2) add it under "Always Included Shaders" list in ProjectSettings/Graphics or 3) put shader or something that references it (e.g. a Material) into a "Resources" folder.

        material.color = Color.green[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color-green.html);  
  
        // assign the material to the renderer
        GetComponent<Renderer[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer.html)>().material = material;
    }
