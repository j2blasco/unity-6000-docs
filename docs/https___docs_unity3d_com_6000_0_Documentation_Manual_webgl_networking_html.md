# Web networking
You can use **networking** The Unity system that enables multiplayer gaming across a computer network. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/multiplayer.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Networking) in Web in the following ways:
  * Use the [UnityWebRequest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/web-request.html) class.
  * [Use the Unity Netcode networking package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/webgl-networking.html#UsingNetcode).


## Use the UnityWebRequest class in Web
Unity supports the [UnityWebRequest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) class in Web. To implement the UnityWebRequest class, Unity uses the JavaScript Fetch API, which uses the browser to handle web requests. This imposes security restrictions on accessing cross-domain resources. 
If you send a web request to a server other than the one that hosts the Unity content, the server you’re sending it to must authorize the Unity content.
To access cross-domain web resources in Web, the server you are trying to access needs to use [cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-cors-protocol) to authorize cross-domain web resources.
If you try to access content using UnityWebRequest, and the remote server doesn’t have CORS set up or configured correctly, an error like the following appears in the browser console:
```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://myserver.com/. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.

```

The server needs to add Access-Control headers to the http responses it sends out, to indicate which web pages have permission to read that information from a web browser.
For a demonstration of how to add Access-Control headers that allow Unity Web to access resources on a web server from any origin, refer to the following example. This example includes common request headers and allows the GET, POST or OPTIONS methods:
```
"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true",
"Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Accept, X-Access-Token, X-Application-Name, X-Request-Sent-Time",
"Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, POST, OPTIONS",
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",

```

### **UnityWebRequest downloads**
Don’t use code that blocks a UnityWebRequest download, such as this:
```
while(!www.isDone) {}

```

Web browsers do not allow synchronously blocking code execution to wait for a network transfer. Therefore, if you need to perform a synchronous style UnityWebRequest, use a [Coroutine](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Coroutines.html) and a yield statement to wait for the download to finish. For more information, see [Examples of coroutines using UnityWebRequest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/web-request-hlapi.html).
## Use the Unity Netcode networking package
Due to security restrictions, web browsers do not allow direct access to TCP or UDP sockets. Instead, you can use the Unity Netcode networking package, which supports Web platform. For more information, refer to the documentation [About Netcode for GameObjects](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about/) (Unity Multiplayer Networking).
For more information on web browser networking standards, you might want to explore the following: 
  * [The WebSocket Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) (Datatracker)
  * [WebRTC: Real-Time Communication in Browsers](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/) (W3)
  * [WebTransport](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/) (W3).


## Limitations of Web networking
There are a few networking features that Web platform doesn’t support. 
### No support for .NET networking classes
You can’t use any .NET networking classes within the Web platform because JavaScript code doesn’t have direct access to internet protocol (IP) sockets to implement network connectivity. Specifically, Web doesn’t support any .NET classes within the `System.Net` namespace.
### No support for native socket access
Web platform does not support native socket access because of security limitations within browsers. Therefore, Web also doesn’t support features like [UnityEngine.Ping](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Ping.html) (ICMP).
