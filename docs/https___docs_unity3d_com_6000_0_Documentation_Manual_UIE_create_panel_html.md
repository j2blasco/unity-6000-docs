# Create a panel
The panel serves as the root element where UI hierarchies attach, and renders the UI in the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) at runtime. How you configure the Panel Settings asset determines how the UI is rendered. It also determines how the UI reacts to input. For example, the panel that’s visually in the front intercepts clicks from the user before the panels that are visually in the back.
You can configure the Panel Settings asset to do the following:
  * Control scale and resolution
  * Apply default styles
  * Display UI on Render Textures
  * Set the panel’s sort order


To create a panel:
  1. In your project, select **Assets** > **Create** > **UI Toolkit** > **Panel Settings** to create a Panel Settings asset if you don’t have it.
  2. In the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector) window of the Panel Settings asset, configure the [Panel Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UIE-Runtime-Panel-Settings.html) properties.
