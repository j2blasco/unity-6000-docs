### Description
Add this function to a subclass to get a notification just before an audio clip is being imported.
This lets you control the import settings trough code.
```
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class MyAudioPostprocessor : AssetPostprocessor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.html)
{
    void OnPreprocessAudio()
    {
        if (assetPath.Contains("mono"))
        {
            AudioImporter[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioImporter.html) audioImporter = (AudioImporter[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioImporter.html))assetImporter;
            audioImporter.forceToMono = true;
        }
    }
}
