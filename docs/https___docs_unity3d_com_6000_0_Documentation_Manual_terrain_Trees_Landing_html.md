Create trees with Tree Editor
# Trees
Trees add realism, interest, and a sense of place to a **terrain** The landscape in your scene. A Terrain GameObject adds a large flat plane to your scene and you can use the Terrain’s Inspector window to create a detailed landscape. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/terrain-UsingTerrains.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Terrain). 
There are two ways to create new tree models:
  * Use the [Tree Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Tree.html) to create tree models in the Unity Editor. The Tree Editor works only with the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline). For most uses, the SpeedTree Modeler replaces the Tree Editor. For backward compatibility with content created before SpeedTree was introduced, use Tree Editor.
  * Use the [SpeedTree Modeler](https://store.speedtree.com) to create trees with advanced visual effects, such as smooth **level of detail** The _Level Of Detail_ (LOD) technique is an optimization that reduces the number of triangles that Unity has to render for a GameObject when its distance from the Camera increases. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LevelOfDetail.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#levelofdetail) (LOD) transition, fast billboarding, and natural wind animation. SpeedTree supports the Built-In Render Pipeline, the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), and the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). For more information, refer to the [SpeedTree Modeler documentation](http://docs9.speedTree.com/).

---|---  
[**Create trees with Tree Editor**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Tree.html) | Create trees in the Unity Editor with the Tree Editor. For the Built-In Render Pipeline only.  
[**Import trees from SpeedTree**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SpeedTree-landing.html) | Import and use trees from SpeedTree for any render pipeline.  
[**Tree level of detail (LOD)**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/terrain-Tree-LOD.html) | Learn how Tree Editor and SpeedTree optimize tree rendering.  
[**Add collision to trees**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/terrain-Tree-Colliders.html) | Add **collision** A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collision) to trees with a Capsule **Collider** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collider) or a SpeedTree Collision object.  
[**Add trees to the terrain**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/terrain-Trees.html) | Add trees with the Paint Trees tool.  
[**Animate trees with Wind Zones**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-WindZone.html) | Use the **Wind Zone** A GameObject that adds the effect of wind to your terrain. For instance, Trees within a wind zone will bend in a realistic animated fashion and the wind itself will move in pulses to create natural patterns of movement among the tree. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-WindZone.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#windzone) **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) to animate tree movement.
