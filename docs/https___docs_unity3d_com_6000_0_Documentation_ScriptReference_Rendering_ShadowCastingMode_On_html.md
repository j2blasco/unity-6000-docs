### Description
Shadows are cast from this object.
Shadow rendering will use the same culling mode as specified in the object's shader. Typically this means that single-sided objects (like a Plane or a Quad) do not cast shadows if the light is behind them. Use [ShadowCastingMode.TwoSided](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.ShadowCastingMode.TwoSided.html) to treat objects as two-sided for shadow rendering.
