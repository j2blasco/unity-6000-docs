### Description
Event that is fired if a log message is received.
This event will be triggered regardless of whether the message comes in on the main thread or not. This means that the handler code has to be thread-safe. It may be invoked from different threads and may be invoked in parallel. Make sure to only access Unity APIs from your handlers that are allowed to be called from threads other than the main thread.  
  
**Note:** It is not necessary to subscribe to both [Application.logMessageReceived](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-logMessageReceived.html) and `Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded`. The multi-threaded variant will also be called for messages on the main thread.  
  
Additional resources: [Application.logMessageReceived](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-logMessageReceived.html).

using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public string output = "";
    public string stack = "";  
  
    void OnEnable()
    {
        Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-logMessageReceivedThreaded.html) += HandleLog;
    }  
  
    void OnDisable()
    {
        Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-logMessageReceivedThreaded.html) -= HandleLog;
    }  
  
    void HandleLog(string logString, string stackTrace, LogType[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LogType.html) type)
    {
        output = logString;
        stack = stackTrace;
    }
}
