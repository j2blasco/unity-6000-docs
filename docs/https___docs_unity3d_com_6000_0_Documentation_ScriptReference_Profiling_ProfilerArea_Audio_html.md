### Description
Audio statistics.
NOTE: Collecting audio samples adds a particularly high amount of profiling overhead. Consider turning this area off when you don't need it. See [Profiler.SetAreaEnabled](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Profiler.SetAreaEnabled.html).
