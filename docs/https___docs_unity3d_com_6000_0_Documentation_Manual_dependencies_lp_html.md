Package dependency and resolution
# Dependencies
The concept of dependencies is fundamental to Unityâ€™s Package Manager behavior.
A dependency is a package that your project or another package needs to work.
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
**[Package dependency and resolution](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-dependencies.html)** | Learn about the different types of dependencies and how Package Manager resolves them.  
**[Package version conflict and resolution](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-conflicts.html)** | Learn how Package Manager resolves package version conflicts when computing a compatible set of packages.  
**[Embedded dependencies](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-embed.html)** | Embed a package in your project to make it **mutable** You can change the contents of a mutable package. This is the opposite of **immutable**. Only **Local package****s** and **Embedded package****s** are mutable.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Mutable).  
**[Lock files](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-conflicts-auto.html)** | Learn about lock files, which Package Manager uses to store the results of dependency resolution for a project.  
**[Local folder or tarball paths](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-localpath.html)** | Specify a dependency as a local folder or tarball that contains a package.
