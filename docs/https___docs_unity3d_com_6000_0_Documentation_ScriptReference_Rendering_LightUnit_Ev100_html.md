### Description
A value that represents a combination of a camera's shutter speed and f-number.
It is essentially a measurement of exposure such that all combinations of shutter speed and f-number that yield the same level of exposure have the same EV. Lights can use EV100, which is EV with a 100 International Standards Organisation (ISO) film.
