public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)

    {
        new Foo();
    }
}  
  
[RequireDerived]
class Foo {}  
  
// UnusedFoo is not used, however, it will survive managed code stripping due to Foo having the [RequireDerived] attribute.
class UnusedFoo : Foo
{
    // Note that unused members of UnusedFoo will still be removed by managed code stripping
    public static void UnusedMethod() {}
}  
  

// Bar is not used so it will be removed by managed code stripping
[RequireDerived]
class Bar {}  
  
// Because Bar is not used, the [RequireDerived] attribute on Bar has no impact.  UnusedBar will also be removed.
class UnusedBar : Bar {}
