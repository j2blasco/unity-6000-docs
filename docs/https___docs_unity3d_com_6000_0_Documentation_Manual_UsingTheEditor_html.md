This section provides a detailed tour of the most common editor windows, and how to make full use of them.
![The most common windows in their default positions](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/using-editor-window.png) The most common windows in their default positions
  * **(A)** [The Toolbar](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Toolbar.html) provides access to your Unity Account and Unity Cloud Services. It also contains controls for Play mode; Undo history; [Unity Search](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/search-overview.html); a layer visibility menu; and the Editor layout menu.
  * **(B)** [The Hierarchy window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Hierarchy.html) is a hierarchical text representation of every **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) in the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene). Each item in the Scene has an entry in the hierarchy, so the two windows are inherently linked. The hierarchy reveals the structure of how GameObjects attach to each other.
  * **(C)** [The Game view](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GameView.html) simulates what your final rendered game will look like through your Scene **Cameras** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera). When you click the Play button, the simulation begins.
  * **(D)** [The Scene view](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html) allows you to visually navigate and edit your Scene. The **Scene view** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SceneView) can display a 3D or 2D perspective, depending on the type of Project you are working on.
  * **(E)** [Overlays](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/overlays.html) contain the basic tools for manipulating the Scene view and the GameObjects within it. You can also add custom Overlays to improve your workflow.
  * **(F)** [The Inspector window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html) allows you to view and edit all the properties of the currently selected GameObject. Because different types of GameObjects have different sets of properties, the layout and contents of the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector) window change each time you select a different GameObject.
  * **(G)** [The Project window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ProjectView.html) displays your library of Assets that are available to use in your Project. When you import Assets into your Project, they appear here.
  * **(H)** [The status bar](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/StatusBar.html) provides notifications about various Unity processes, and quick access to related tools and settings.
