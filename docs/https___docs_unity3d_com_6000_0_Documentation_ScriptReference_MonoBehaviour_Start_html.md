### Description
Start is called on the frame when a script is enabled just before any of the Update methods are called the first time.
Like the [Awake](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html) function, Start is called exactly once in the lifetime of the script. Start may not be called on the same frame as [Awake](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html) if the script is not enabled at initialisation time.  
  
The [Awake](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html) function is called on all objects in the Scene before any object's Start function is called. This fact is useful in cases where object A's initialisation code needs to rely on object B's already being initialised; B's initialisation should be done in [Awake](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html), while A's should be done in Start.  
  
Where objects are instantiated during gameplay, their [Awake](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html) function is called after the Start functions of Scene objects have already completed.  
  
The Start function can be defined as a [Coroutine](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Coroutine.html), which allows [Start](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Start.html) to suspend its execution (yield).
```
// Initializes the target variable.
// target is private and thus not editable in the Inspector  
  
// The ExampleClass starts with Awake.  The GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) class has activeSelf
// set to false.  When activeSelf is set to true the Start() and Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
// functions will be called causing the ExampleClass to run.
// Note that ExampleClass (Script) in the Inspector is turned off.  It
// needs to be ticked to make script call Start.
