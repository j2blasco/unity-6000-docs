enableBumpByDefault; 
### Description
Gets and sets a boolean to enable normal mapping on the imported SpeedTree model.
Normal mapping (or bump mapping) provides more surface detail with normal map textures to increase the visual fidelity. The default value for this variable is `true`.  
  
To change this setting for a specific LOD, see [SpeedTreeImporter.enableBump](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter-enableBump.html) and [SpeedTreeImporter.enableSettingOverride](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter-enableSettingOverride.html).
