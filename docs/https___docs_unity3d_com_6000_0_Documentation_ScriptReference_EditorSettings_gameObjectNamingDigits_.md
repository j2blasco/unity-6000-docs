gameObjectNamingDigits; 
### Description
Indicates the amount of digits to use for the numbers in a duplicated GameoObject's name.
By default, Unity adds successive numbers to a duplicated GameObject's name. `gameObjectNamingDigits` sets the minimum amount of digits in the numbers.  
  
For example, setting [EditorSettings.gameObjectNamingDigits](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorSettings-gameObjectNamingDigits.html) to 3 results in instances of "Prefab" being named "Prefab (001)", "Prefab (002)" and so on.
