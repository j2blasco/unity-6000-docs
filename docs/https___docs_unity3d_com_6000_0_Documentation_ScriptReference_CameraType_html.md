### Description
Describes different types of camera.
The Unity Editor sets the type of a camera based on what it is used for. When selecting a model asset in the project the preview in the Inspector will be rendered with a camera that has the type Preview. A camera in the Scene Hierarchy will have the type Game. The preview window shown when selecting a camera in the Scene Hierarchy is a copy of the selected camera, and will therefore have the type Game as well.
