[Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) maxSize; 
### Description
Maximum size of the Overlay.
Overlays can be resized. The maxSize variable is the maximum width and height that the Overlay can be resized. This is typically a Vector2(4000,4000). If the axis of both the minSize and maxSize are set to 0, resizing is disabled for that axis.
