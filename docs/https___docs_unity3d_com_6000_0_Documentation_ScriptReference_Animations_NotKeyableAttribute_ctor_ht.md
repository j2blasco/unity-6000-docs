public NotKeyableAttribute(); 
### Description
Use this attribute in a script to mark a property as non-animatable.
A non-animatable property cannot have key animation (not keyable). It does not appear as animatable in the Animation window and it cannot be animated in the [Animator](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animator.html) component or the [Animation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animation.html) component.
