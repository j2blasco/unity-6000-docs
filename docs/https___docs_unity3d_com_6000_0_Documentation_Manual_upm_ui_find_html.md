# Find packages and feature sets
The Package Manager window provides several ways to help you find a specific package or **feature set** A feature set is a collection of related packages that you can use to achieve specific results in the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in Unity’s Package Manager. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Featureset):
![The navigation panel and several controls at the top of the Package Manager window help you narrow down the list of packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/upm-ui-find.png) The navigation panel and several controls at the top of the Package Manager window help you narrow down the list of packages **Window control** | **Description**  
---|---  
Navigation panel (A) | Choose a [context](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-nav.html#contexts) from the navigation panel to determine which list of packages display. The context might be the source of the package, such as a registry server, the Asset Store, or the Unity Editor itself (for built-in packages). However, the **In Project** context displays only those packages and feature sets that are already installed in the current project, regardless of their origin.  
  
For example, you can choose the **My Assets** context to display only Asset Store packages available to you in the list, or choose the **In Project** context to display Asset Store packages, Unity packages, and feature sets that are already installed in your project.  
Sort control (B) |  [Sort](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-sort.html) the list in either ascending or descending order by name, published date (**Unity Registry** , **My Registries** , **In Project** only), purchased date (Asset Store packages only), or recently updated (**My Assets** only).   
  
For example, if you want to find an Asset Store package that had a recent update but you can’t remember the name of it, select **My Assets** , then sort by **Recently updated** and browse the list to find it.   
  
Sorting affects the items under each collapsible section, but leaves the sections in place. If you sort from Z-A, the Package Manager reorders all the feature sets from Z-A inside the **Features** section, and all the packages under each section, but doesn’t mix the content in the list.  
Filter controls (C) | Use the [filter controls](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-filter2.html) to narrow down the packages listed. Packages listed in **My Assets** have enhanced filtering options:  
  
- **Status** (Downloaded, Imported, Update available, Unlabeled, Hidden, Deprecated)  
- **Categories** (3D, Add-Ons, 2D, Audio, etc.)  
- **Labels** (Custom labels you define in the Asset Store)  
Search box (D) | Use the [search box](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-search.html) to look for a Unity package or an **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore) package by name.  
Use these controls to narrow down which packages and feature sets appear in the [list panel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-list.html) and in what order. This makes it easier to find what you’re looking for, or help you browse when you don’t know exactly what you want.
When you use several of these controls together, you narrow the set of matches that appears in the list.
After you find a package from a registry (not Asset Store), you can select it, then potentially [locate a specific version](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-find-ver.html) in the [details panel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-details.html). For feature sets, there’s always only one version available, so you can either [install it or remove it](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/fs-install.html).
