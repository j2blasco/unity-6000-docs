### Description
The vertex data layout to use when prewarming shader variants.
For information on shader loading and prewarming, including a list of different prewarming techniques, see [Shader loading](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-loading.html).  
  
On modern graphics APIs, such as DX12, Metal, and Vulkan, the graphics driver uses the vertex data layout when it creates shader progams. Use this to correctly prewarm shader variants for these graphics APIs.
