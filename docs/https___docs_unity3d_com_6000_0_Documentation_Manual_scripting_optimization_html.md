# Code optimization
Considering performance in all the code you write helps your project scale without bottlenecks. There are several ways you can improve performance, including avoiding bad practices, [profiling](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Profiler.html) your code, implementing appropriate design patterns, and using techniques like asynchronous programming to split work across multiple threads of execution.
