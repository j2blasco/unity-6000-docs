Introduction to rendering paths in URP
# Rendering paths in URP
Resources for choosing between the Forward, Forward+, and Deferred **rendering paths** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#RenderingPath) in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).
**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to rendering paths](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/rendering-paths-introduction-urp.html) | Understand the differences between the Forward, Forward+ and Deferred rendering paths in URP.  
[Choose a rendering path](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/rendering-paths-comparison.html) | Decide which rendering path to use for your Universal Render Pipeline (URP) project, depending on the type of project and the target hardware.  
[Set the rendering path](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/rendering-paths-set.html) | Use the **Rendering Path** setting in the Universal Renderer asset to set the rendering path.  
[Forward and Forward+ rendering paths](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/rendering/forward-rendering-paths.html) | Learn more about the Forward and Forward+ rendering paths in URP.  
[Deferred rendering path](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/rendering/deferred-rendering-path-landing.html) | Resources for using the Deferred rendering path, which has no limit on the number of lights that can affect an opaque **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject).  
[Troubleshooting the Forward+ rendering path](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/rendering/forward-plus-rendering-path-limitations.html) | Solve common issues with the Forward+ rendering path, for example reduce the maximum number of visible lights to reduce build times.
