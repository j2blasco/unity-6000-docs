### Description
Describes options for displaying movie playback controls.
**Windows Store Apps** : OS doesn't provide a **Stop** button control because of this Unity will stop a video if **Escape** or **Back Button** is pressed if video is launched with [FullScreenMovieControlMode.Full](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FullScreenMovieControlMode.Full.html) or [FullScreenMovieControlMode.Minimal](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FullScreenMovieControlMode.Minimal.html) parameters.
