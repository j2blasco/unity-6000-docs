### Description
LZ4 compression results in larger compressed files than LZMA, but does not require the entire bundle to be decompressed before use.
LZ4 compression makes it possible to load individual Assets from an Asset Bundle quickly and using less memory than LZMA compressed Asset Bundles. This compression method is available for recompression at runtime.
