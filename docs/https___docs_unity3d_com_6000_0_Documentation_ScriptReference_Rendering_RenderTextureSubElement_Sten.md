### Description
The stencil element of a RenderTexture.
Use this to access the stencil data of the underlying surface from a Render Texture and then bind it in a Shader. Before you create the RenderTexture, make sure to set the stencil format to one that the target platform supports.  
  
To access the stencil information in a Shader, you must read it from the correct channel. The stencil data is stored in the red channel for all graphics APIs that support it except for DirectX 11, in which case it is stored in the green channel.  
  
If the stencilFormat is set to `R8_UInt`, you need to use the function Load to read from the Texture. Otherwise, if the format is `R8_UNorm` you can use sampling.  
  
When using MSAA RenderTextures, you need to define the Stencil Texture using the equivalent MS Texture types.  
  
You cannot bind the stencil buffer as a RWTexture.  
  
Below is an example Unlit shader that reads the stencil information from a RenderTexture with stencilFormat `R8_UInt` and writes it as color information on the green channel.
