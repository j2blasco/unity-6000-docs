# Android plug-in types
Unity supports multiple **plug-in** A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Plug-in) types for Android applications. Each plug-in type has its own capabilities so, if you want to create your own plug-in for a particular use-case, make sure to select the most relevant plug-in type for the use-case.
