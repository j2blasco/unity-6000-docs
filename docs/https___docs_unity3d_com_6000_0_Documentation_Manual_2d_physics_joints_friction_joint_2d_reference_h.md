Hinge Joint 2D
# Friction Joint 2D component reference
The **Friction**Joint** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint) 2D** connects **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) controlled by **Rigidbody** A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Rigidbody) 2D physics. The Friction Joint 2D reduces both the linear and angular velocities between the objects to zero (ie, it slows them down).
## Properties
**Property** | **Function**  
---|---  
**Enable**Collision** A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collision)** | Enable this property to enable collisions between the two connected GameObjects.  
**Connected Rigid Body** | Specify the other object this joint connects to. Leave this as **None** to have the other end of the joint fixed at a point in space defined by the **Connected Anchor** property. Select the circle icon to the right to view a list of GameObjects to connect to.  
**Auto Configure Connected Anchor** | Enable this property to automatically set the anchor location for the other object this joint connects to. You do not need to enter coordinates for the **Connected Anchor** property if you enable this property.  
**Anchor** | Define where (in terms of x, y-coordinates on the **Rigidbody 2D**) the end point of the joint connects to this GameObject.  
**Connected Anchor** | Define where (in terms of x, y-coordinates on the **Rigidbody 2D**) the end point of the joint connects to the other GameObject.  
**Max Force** | Set the linear (or straight line) movement between joined GameObjects. A high value resists the linear movement between GameObjects.  
**Max Torque** | Set the angular (or rotation) movement between joined GameObjects. A high value resists the rotation movement between GameObjects.  
**Break Action** | Set the action taken when either the force or torque threshold is exceeded.  
**Break Force** | Set the force threshold which if exceeded, will cause the joint to perform the selected **Break Action**. The default value is set to **Infinity** , which can never be exceeded and therefore the **Break Action** can never be taken while the threshold remains at this value.  
**Break Torque** | Set the torque threshold which if exceeded, will cause the joint to perform the selected **Break Action**. The default value is set to **Infinity** , which can never be exceeded and therefore the **Break Action** can never be taken while the threshold remains at this value.
