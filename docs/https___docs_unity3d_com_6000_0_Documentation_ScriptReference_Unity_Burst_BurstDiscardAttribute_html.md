### Description
Use this attribute to exclude a method or property from being compiled to native code by the Burst compiler.
By default, Burst compiles all methods in jobs decorated with the `[BurstCompile]` attribute. You can use the `[BurstDiscard]` attribute on a method or property to exclude code from Burst compilation in situations where it can only run in .NET runtimes. For example, you can use `[BurstDiscard]` to exclude methods that use managed objects to perform logging, or methods that check the validity of something only valid in a managed environment.
```
using Unity.Burst;
using Unity.Collections;
using Unity.Jobs;
using UnityEngine;  
  
[BurstCompile]
public struct MyJob : IJob[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.IJob.html)
{
    // ...  
  
    [BurstDiscard]
    public void NotExecutedInNative()
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("This is a log from a managed job");
    }  
  
    public void Execute()
    {
        // The following method call will not be compiled
        NotExecutedInNative();
    }
}

```
