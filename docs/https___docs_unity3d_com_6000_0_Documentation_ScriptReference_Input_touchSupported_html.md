touchSupported; 
### Description
Returns whether the device on which application is currently running supports touch input.
**Note** : This API is part of the legacy Input Manager. The recommended best practice is that you don't use this API in new projects. For new projects, use the Input System package. To learn more about input, refer to [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Input.html).  
  
Rather than checking the platform, use this property to determine whether your game should expect touch input, as some platforms can support multiple input methods.
