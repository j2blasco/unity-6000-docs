[pixelSnapSpacing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/U2D.PixelPerfectRendering-pixelSnapSpacing.html) | To achieve a pixel perfect render, Sprites must be displaced to discrete positions at render time. This value defines the minimum distance between these positions. This doesnâ€™t affect the GameObject's transform position.
