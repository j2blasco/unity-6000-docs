### Description
Called when a joint attached to the same game object broke.
When a force that is higher than the breakForce of the joint, the joint will break off. When the joint breaks off, OnJointBreak will be called and the break force applied to the joint will be passed in. After OnJointBreak the joint will automatically be removed from the game object and deleted.
