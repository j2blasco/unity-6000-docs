Use deep linking on UWP
# Develop for Universal Windows Platform
Before you develop for Universal Windows Platform (UWP), you can find out more about the following topics:
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Use deep linking on UWP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/deep-linking-universal-windows-platform.html) | Use deep linking on UWP devices.  
[Connect the profiler to UWP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/windowsstore-profiler.html) | Connect Unity’s **profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Profiler) to your UWP application.  
[UWP scripting symbols](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/uwp-defines.html) | Learn what scripting symbols are available for UWP.  
[IL2CPP scripting backend for UWP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/uwp-il2cpp-scripting.html) | Use **plug-ins** A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Plug-in) and debug your UWP applications with **IL2CPP** A Unity-developed scripting back-end which you can use as an alternative to Mono when building projects for some platforms. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scripting-backends-il2cpp.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#IL2CPP).  
[WinRT API in C# scripts for UWP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/windowsstore-scripts.html) | Use WinRT API directly in Unity **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts) for UWP.  
[AppCallbacks class reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/windowsstore-appcallbacks.html) | Call the AppCallbacks class in your UWP application.  
[Command line arguments for UWP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/windowsstore-commandlinearguments.html) | Use command line arguments in your UWP application.  
[Association launching for UWP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/windowsstore-assocation-launching.html) | Launch the user’s default app for file type or a protocol.
