fixedUnscaledTime; 
### Description
The timeScale-independent time at the beginning of the last [MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html) phase (Read Only). This is the time in seconds since the start of the game.
This value is updated in fixed increments equal to [Time.fixedUnscaledDeltaTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-fixedUnscaledDeltaTime.html).  
  
Unlike [Time.fixedTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-fixedTime.html) this value is not affected by [Time.timeScale](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-timeScale.html).
