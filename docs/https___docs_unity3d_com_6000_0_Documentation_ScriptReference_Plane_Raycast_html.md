## Declaration
public bool Raycast([Ray](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Ray.html) ray, out float enter); 
### Description
Intersects a ray with the plane.
This function sets `enter` to the distance along the ray, where it intersects the plane. If the ray is parallel to the plane, function returns `false` and sets `enter` to zero. If the ray is pointing in the opposite direction than the plane, function returns `false` and sets `enter` to the distance along the ray (negative value).

//This script detects mouse clicks on a plane using Plane.Raycast[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Plane.Raycast.html).
//In this example, the plane is set to the Camera[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html)'s x and y position, but you can set the z position so the plane is in front of your Camera[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html).
//The normal of the plane is set to facing forward so it is facing the Camera[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html), but you can change this to suit your own needs.  
  
//In your GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html)'s Inspector, set your clickable distance and attach a cube GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) in the appropriate fields
