[VRTextureUsage](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/VRTextureUsage.html) vrUsage; 
### Description
If this RenderTexture is a VR eye texture used in stereoscopic rendering, this property decides what special rendering occurs, if any. Instead of setting this manually, use the value returned by [eyeTextureDesc](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.XRSettings-eyeTextureDesc.html) or other VR functions returning a [RenderTextureDescriptor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureDescriptor.html).
