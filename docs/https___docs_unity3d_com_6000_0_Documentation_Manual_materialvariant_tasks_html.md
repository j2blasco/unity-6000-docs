# Create, modify, and apply Material Variants
These instructions explain how to work with Material Variants. Programmers should consult the [Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html)An asset that defines how a surface should be rendered. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Material.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Material) and [MaterialEditor](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MaterialEditor.html) API documentation for information about how to work with Material Variants in **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts).
## Differences between Prefab Variants and Material Variants
The Material Variant workflow is mostly the same as the Prefab Variant workflow. There are two key differences:
  * You can lock one or more Properties of a Material Variant so that no one can edit these Properties in its children
  * It is possible to change the parent of a Material Variant


## Create a Material Variant
There are two ways to create a Material Variant.
### Right-click on a Material in the Project window
  1. Select a Material in the **Project window** A window that shows the contents of your `Assets` folder (Project tab) [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ProjectView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Projectwindow).
  2. Right-click on that Material.
  3. Select **Create** > **Material Variant**.


### Select in the Material Hierarchy
  1. Open the Material Hierarchy dialog.
  2. Select the material type dropdown.
  3. Select **Material Variant**.
  4. Assign a material to the parent field

![The dropdown to create a Material Variant from the Material Hierarchy](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/matlvariant-createfromhierarchy.png) The dropdown to create a Material Variant from the Material Hierarchy
### Identify the new Material Variant
When you create a new Material Variant, it has the name [Material Name] **Variant (Material Variant)** in the Material **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector). When Unity begins to load a new Material Variant, the Material Variant has a striped icon in the Project window. After Unity finishes loading the new Material Variant, the normal Material preview replaces the striped icon in the Project window.
## Add an Override on a Material Variant
  1. Select a Material Variant.
  2. Modify one of its Properties in the Material Inspector.

![The thick line to the left of a Property \(circled in red in this screenshot\) indicates an Override.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/matlvariant-overrides.png) The thick line to the left of a Property (circled in red in this screenshot) indicates an Override.
## Revert one or more Overrides on a Material Variant
  1. Right-click on an Override.
  2. Select **Revert** to revert this specific Override, or select **Revert all Overrides** to revert every Override on this variant. If this Override originated from a child, reverting also applies to that child.


For a detailed explanation of how inheritance determines the effect of reverting changes, see [Material Variant inheritance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/materialvariant-hierarchyconcept.html) or [Revert an Override applied upward](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/materialvariant-tasks.html#revertoverrideappliedupward).
## Apply an Override upward in the hierarchy
You can apply an Override upward to any ancestor in the hierarchy.
![This dropdown makes it possible for you to Revert Overrides, apply them upward, or lock them.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/matlvariant-revert-applyupward.png) This dropdown makes it possible for you to Revert Overrides, apply them upward, or lock them.
### Apply the Override to the parent
To apply an Override to a parent, right-click on an Override and select **Apply to** [name of parent] in the dropdown.
### Apply the Override to an ancestor
To apply an Override to an ancestor, right-click on an Override and select **Apply to** [name of ancestor] in the dropdown.
### Revert one or more Overrides applied upward
Once an Override is applied upward, you can no longer revert it on the child that originated it. Instead, you must revert it on the recipient parent or ancestor; see the instructions in [Revert one or more Overrides on a Material Variant](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/materialvariant-tasks.html#revertoverride).
## Delete a Material Variant
  1. Select the Material Variant in the Project window.
  2. Press the **Delete** key. The next step depends on whether the Material Variant has children. 
     * If the Material Variant has no children, click **Delete** in the warning dialog to delete the variant.
     * If the Material Variant has one or more children, a warning dialog appears that says **One or more of these Material(s) has one or more children. Would you like you reparent all of these children to their closest remaining ancestor?**
       * The warning dialog provides three options: 
         * **Delete and reparent children** : This option causes Unity to automatically assign this parentâ€™s children to their closest ancestor; this new parent can be either a Material Variant or a Material, or no parent if the Material to be deleted is the root of the hierarchy.
         * **Delete only** Note: A Material with a missing parent is in an invalid state and will not load correctly at runtime.
         * **Cancel** See [Inheritance error messages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/materialvariant-hierarchyconcept.html#prevent-the-creation-of-circular-dependencies-or-orphans) for information about orphan Material Variants.


## Reparent a Material Variant
There are two ways to reparent a Material Variant.
### In the Material Inspector
  1. Select the variant you want to reparent in the Project window.
  2. Select the bullseye next to the **Parent** Property and choose a new parent in the **Select Material** dialog.

![Select a new parent](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/matlvariant-reparent.png) Select a new parent
### In the Project window
Drag the new parent Material or Material Variant onto the target child.
## Lock a Property
  1. Right-click on a Property.
  2. Select **Lock in children** in the dropdown.
  3. A padlock icon appears next to the locked Property.


To unlock the property, click **Lock in children** again.

## Convert a Material Variant to a Material
There are two ways to convert a Material Variant to a Material.
### From the Hierarchy View
  1. Select the Material Variant in the Project window.
  2. Expand the Hierarchy dialog in the Material Inspector.
  3. Select **Material** in the Material type dropdown.

![Convert to a Material from the Hierarchy view](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/matlvariant-convertomaterial.png) Convert to a Material from the Hierarchy view
### From the Settings dropdown
  1. Click the Settings dropdown in the Material Inspector.
  2. Select **Flatten Material Variant** in the dropdown.
