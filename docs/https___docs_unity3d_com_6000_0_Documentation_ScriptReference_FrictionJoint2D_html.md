### Description
Applies both force and torque to reduce both the linear and angular velocities to zero.
The joint constantly tries to reduce both the ::Rigidbody2D::velocity and ::Rigidbody2D::angularVelocity to zero. Unlike contact friction which requires two colliders to be in contact, force and torque here are applied continuously.  
  
You can control both the maximum force using [maxForce](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FrictionJoint2D-maxForce.html) and maximum torque using [maxTorque](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FrictionJoint2D-maxTorque.html). Because you can use very high force or torque limits, you can essentially reduce an objects movement to almost zero.  
  
A typical usage for this joint might be to simulate top-down surface friction or to simulate stiff rotation of an object.
