[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) max; 
### Description
The maximum rotation away from the initial value that this muscle can apply.
The [center](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HumanLimit-center.html) property specifies the rotation of the bone when the muscle is at "rest". The `max` value specfies the maximum rotation in degrees away from the rest value that the muscle can apply. The [min](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HumanLimit-min.html) value specifies a similar limit but in the negative direction of rotation.  
  
The allowed range for the maximum is 0..180 degrees.
