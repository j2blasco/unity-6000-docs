### Description
Font rendering mode constants for TrueTypeFontImporter.
### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[Smooth](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FontRenderingMode.Smooth.html) | Use Anti-Aliased Font rendering. When using dynamic fonts, this is the mode which is fastest in rendering font textures.  
[HintedSmooth](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FontRenderingMode.HintedSmooth.html) | Use Anti-Aliased Font rendering with hinting. This forces character lines to run along pixel boundaries.  
[HintedRaster](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FontRenderingMode.HintedRaster.html) | Use hinted font rendering without anti-aliasing. This is the crispest font rendering option, and may be most readable for small font sizes.  
[OSDefault](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FontRenderingMode.OSDefault.html) | Use the OS default font rendering mode. This mode is only available for dynamic fonts, as static fonts are generated at build time.
