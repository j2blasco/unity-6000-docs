### Description
[XRInputSubsystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.XRInputSubsystem.html) tracks all [InputDevice](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.InputDevice.html)s in reference to the first known location of a specific [InputDevice](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.InputDevice.html) when set to TrackingOriginModeFlags.Device.
For mobile AR applications, the [InputDevice](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.InputDevice.html) is the mobile device the application is running on. For head-mounted device applications, the head-mounted device acts as the root.
