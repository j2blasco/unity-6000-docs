### Description
A change of this type indicates that a [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) has been created, possibly with additional objects below it in the hierarchy. This happens for example when [Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo.html) is used with a [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html).
