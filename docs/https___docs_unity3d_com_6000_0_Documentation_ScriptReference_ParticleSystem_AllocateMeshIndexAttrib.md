### Description
Ensures that the [meshIndices](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemJobs.ParticleSystemJobData-meshIndices.html) particle attribute array is allocated.
This is important if you want to use this attribute in a job, such as [IJobParticleSystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemJobs.IJobParticleSystem.html).
