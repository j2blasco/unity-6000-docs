## Declaration
public static GameObject[] UnpackPrefabInstanceAndReturnNewOutermostRoots([GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) instanceRoot, [PrefabUnpackMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PrefabUnpackMode.html) unpackMode); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
instanceRoot | Root GameObject of the Prefab instance.  
unpackMode | The unpack mode to use.  
### Returns
**GameObject[]** Array of GameObjects representing roots of unpacked Prefab instances. 
### Description
Unpacks the given Prefab instance using the behaviour specified by unpackMode.
If the PrefabUnpackMode is the PrefabUnpackMode.OutermostRoot this function will return any new Prefab root GameObjects from any nested Prefabs at the first level.  
  
Unlike [UnpackPrefabInstance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PrefabUtility.UnpackPrefabInstance.html), this function canâ€™t be made undoable. You will have to handle undo yourself.  
  
See [UnpackPrefabInstance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PrefabUtility.UnpackPrefabInstance.html) for a full description of the unpacking behaviour.
