## Declaration
public static bool IsPartOfVariantPrefab([Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Object.html) componentOrGameObject); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
componentOrGameObject | The object to check. Must be a component or GameObject.  
### Returns
**bool** True if the object is part of a Prefab Variant. 
### Description
Returns true if the given object is part of a Prefab Variant Asset or Prefab Variant instance.
An object is part of a Prefab Variant instance if it has a Prefab Variant as its outermost Prefab instance root. To get the outermost Prefab instance root, use [GetOutermostPrefabInstanceRoot](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PrefabUtility.GetOutermostPrefabInstanceRoot.html).  
  
For Prefab contents loaded in Prefab Mode, this method will not check the Prefab Asset the loaded contents are loaded from, since these Prefab contents are loaded into a preview scene and are not part of an asset while being edited in Prefab Mode. This means that for Prefab contents in Prefab Mode, the method will only return true for objects are part of a Prefab Variant instance. To check if an object is part of the Prefabâ€™s contents in Prefab Mode, use [PrefabStage.IsPartOfPrefabContents](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.PrefabStage.IsPartOfPrefabContents.html).
