clipAnimations; 
### Description
Animation clips to split animation into. Additional resources: [ModelImporterClipAnimation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporterClipAnimation.html).
When you import a file for the first time clipAnimations will be always empty. If you need to populate clipAnimations before the first import you can use an [AssetPostprocessor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.html) and override [AssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessAnimation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessAnimation.html).
```
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class CreateAnimationClip : AssetPostprocessor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.html)
{
    void OnPreprocessAnimation()
    {
        var modelImporter = assetImporter as ModelImporter[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporter.html);
        modelImporter.clipAnimations = modelImporter.defaultClipAnimations;
    }
}

```
