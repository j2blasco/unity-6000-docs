## Declaration
public static bool IsPartOfImmutablePrefab([Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Object.html) componentOrGameObject); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
componentOrGameObject | The object to check. Must be a component or GameObject.  
### Returns
**bool** True if the object is part of a Prefab that cannot be edited. 
### Description
Returns true if the given object is part of a Prefab that cannot be edited.
If the object is part of a Prefab Asset, the asset itself is checked. If the object is part of a Prefab instance, its corresponding asset is checked.  
  
Examples of immutable Prefabs are Model Prefabs and Prefabs in read-only folders.  
  
For Prefab contents loaded in Prefab Mode, this method will not check the Prefab Asset the loaded contents are loaded from, since these Prefab contents are loaded into a preview scene and are not part of an asset while being edited in Prefab Mode. This means that for Prefab contents in Prefab Mode, the method will only return true for objects that are part of a Prefab instance that have corresponding assets that are immutable. To check if an object is part of the Prefabâ€™s contents in Prefab Mode, use [PrefabStage.IsPartOfPrefabContents](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.PrefabStage.IsPartOfPrefabContents.html).
