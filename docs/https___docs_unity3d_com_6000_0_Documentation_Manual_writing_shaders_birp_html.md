Writing Surface Shaders
# Writing custom shaders in the Built-In Render Pipeline
Resources for writing HLSL code and Surface **Shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) in the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)

[Get the current framebuffer with the GrabPass command](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/writing-shader-grabpass.html) | Create a special type of Pass that grabs the contents of the frame buffer into a texture, so you can use it in subsequent passes to do advanced image based effects.
