Introduction to lighting
# Lighting
![A scene with photo-realistic lighting.](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/ProgressiveLightmapper-0.jpg) A scene with photo-realistic lighting.
With Unity, you can achieve realistic lighting that is suitable for a range of art styles.

[Introduction to lighting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightingInUnity.html) | Resources for learning about lighting and choosing a lighting setup.  
[Lighting configuration workflow](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/lighting-configuration-workflow.html) | Resources for selecting a **render pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline), configuring global lighting settings, and adding lighting elements.  
[Light sources](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/lighting-light-sources.html) | Resources for adding light to a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene), with Light components, **ambient light** Light that doesnâ€™t come from any specific direction, and contributes equal light in all directions to the Scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/lighting-window.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Ambientlight), emissive materials, and cookies.  
[Direct and indirect lighting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/direct-and-indirect-lighting.html) | Resources on choosing whether Unity calculates **global illumination** A group of techniques that model both direct and indirect lighting to provide realistic lighting results.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#globalillumination) in real time, or stores baked lighting in a build.  
[Shadows](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shadows.html)A UI component that adds a simple outline effect to graphic components such as Text or Image. It must be on the same GameObject as the graphic component. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/script-Shadow.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shadow) | Techniques and resources for Lights casting shadows from a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) onto other parts of itself, or onto nearby GameObjects.  
[Reflections](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/reflections-landing.html) | Techniques and resources for using **Reflection Probes** A rendering component that captures a spherical view of its surroundings in all directions, rather like a camera. The captured image is then stored as a Cubemap that can be used by objects with reflective materials. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ReflectionProbe.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#ReflectionProbe) to capture and display reflections on GameObjects.  
[Lighting in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/lighting-landing.html) | Resources and approaches for lighting in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).  
[Lighting in the Built-In Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/lighting-birp.html) | Resources and approaches for lighting in the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Lighting reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/lighting-reference.html) | Explore lighting properties and settings, for example in the Lighting window, the Lighting Settings Asset, and Debug Draw Modes.
