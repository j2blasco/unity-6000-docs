playbackSpeed; 
### Description
Factor by which the basic playback rate will be multiplied.
Only works if [VideoPlayer.canSetPlaybackSpeed](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-canSetPlaybackSpeed.html) is `true`. Setting this to 2.0 will play the clip twice as fast as its normal speed. Support for negative values is platform dependent.
