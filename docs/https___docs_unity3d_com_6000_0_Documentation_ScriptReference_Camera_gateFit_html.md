### Description
There are two gates for a camera, the sensor gate and the resolution gate. The physical camera sensor gate is defined by the [sensorSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-sensorSize.html) property, the resolution gate is defined by the render target area.
To use this property, enable [usePhysicalProperties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-usePhysicalProperties.html). Additional resources: [GateFitMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.GateFitMode.html) enum.
