Windows and macOS platforms only. Sets your application window to the operating system's definition of maximized. 
On Windows, it's a full-screen window with a title bar. On macOS, it is a full-screen window with a hidden menu bar and dock. On other platforms, this mode falls back to [FullScreenMode.FullScreenWindow](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FullScreenMode.FullScreenWindow.html).
