farClipPlane; 
### Description
The distance of the far clipping plane from the Camera, in world units.
The far clipping plane is furthest point of the Camera's view frustum. The Camera cannot see geometry that is further this distance. For more information, see [Understanding the view frustum](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UnderstandingFrustum.html).  
  
In the Unity Editor, this corresponds to the **Clipping Planes: Far** property in the Camera component Inspector.
