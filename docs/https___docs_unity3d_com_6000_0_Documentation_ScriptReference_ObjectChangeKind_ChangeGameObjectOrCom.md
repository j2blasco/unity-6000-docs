### Description
A change of this type indicates that a property of a [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) or [Component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.html) has changed. This happens for example when [Undo.RecordObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.RecordObject.html) is used with an instance of a [Component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.html).
