## Declaration
public static bool HasUserAuthorization([UserAuthorization](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UserAuthorization.html) mode); 
### Description
This has the same functionality as [Application.HasUserAuthorization](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application.HasUserAuthorization.html). At the moment, the Device Simulator doesn't support simulation of this method.
