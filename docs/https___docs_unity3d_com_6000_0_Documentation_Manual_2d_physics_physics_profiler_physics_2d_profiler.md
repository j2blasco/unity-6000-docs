# Physics 2D Profiler module reference
The Physics 2D **Profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Profiler) module displays information about the physics that the physics system has processed in your project’s **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene). This information can help you diagnose and resolve performance issues or unexpected discrepancies related to the physics in your project’s scene.
To open the Profiler window, go to menu: **Window** > **Analysis** > **Profiler**.
## Chart categories
The Physics 2D Profiler module’s chart tracks different statistics related to the physics that the physics system processes in the project’s scene, divided into the following chart categories. Click on the frame chart window or select a captured frame in the chart graph to track selected categories. To change the order of the categories in the chart, drag and drop them in the chart’s legend. You can also click a category’s colored legend to toggle its display. Refer to the [module details pane](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/physics-profiler/physics-2d-profiler-module-reference.html#module-details-pane) for more information about the selected statistics.
**Chart** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Total Contacts** | The total number of contacts that were present in this frame. This includes both **Collision** A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)

**Total Shapes** | The total number of [physics shapes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D.html) that were present in this frame. Different [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) produce different amounts of physics shapes ranging from one to unlimited. You can get the [shape count](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D-shapeCount.html) and [retrieve the physics shapes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.GetShapes.html) to determine this for any Collider2D.  
**Total Queries** | The total number of queries that were called this frame. This includes queries such as [Physics2D.Raycast](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics2D.Raycast.html), [Physics2D.OverlapPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics2D.OverlapPoint.html) etc.

**Dynamic Bodies** | The total number of Rigidbody2D with a [Dynamic](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyType2D.Dynamic.html) **body type** Defines a fixed behavior for a 2D Rigidbody. Can be Dynamic (the body moves under simulation and is affected by forces like gravity), Kinematic (the body moves under simulation, but and isn’t affected by forces like gravity) or Static (the body doesn’t move under simulation). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/rigidbody/introduction-to-rigidbody-2d.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#BodyType) that were present in this frame. Dynamic bodies take the most processing of all body types therefore they should be kept to a minimum.  
**Continuous Bodies** | The total number of Rigidbody2D with a [Continuous](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CollisionDetectionMode2D.Continuous.html) **collision detection** An automatic process performed by Unity which determines whether a moving GameObject with a Rigidbody and collider component has come into contact with any other colliders.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#CollisionDetection) mode that were present in this frame. Continuous bodies are much more expensive than when using **Discrete collision detection** A collision detection method that calculates and resolves collisions based on the pose of objects at the end of each physics simulation step. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#discretecollisiondetection) mode therefore they should be kept to a minimum.  
**Physics Used Memory** | The total amount of persistent memory used exclusively by the 2D physics system. This includes both the core engine and the memory used by each physics component, but does not include the temporary memory used in this frame.  
## Module details pane 
When you select a frame in the Physics 2D Profiler module, the details pane displays detailed information about the physics in your project’s scene. The details pane is sorted by category, where each category exists on a single line.
The following reference table describes the statistics available, plus its corresponding **profiler counter** Placed in code with the ProfilerCounter API to track metrics, such as the number of enemies spawned in your game. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/https:/docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.profiling.core@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/profilercounter-guide.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Profilercounter), and availability in Release builds. The profiler counters are always available in the Editor and **Development builds** A development build includes debug symbols and enables the Profiler. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/https:/docs.unity.com/devops/en/manual/build-target-configurations#Build_target_advanced_settings_overview)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#DevelopmentBuild). This information is also available via the [ProfilerRecorder API](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Profiling.ProfilerRecorder.html) and in the [Profiler Module Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/profiler-module-editor.html) so you can add them to a custom Profiler module.

---|---|---|---  
**World Count** | The total number of [physics scene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene2D.html) that were present in this frame. Each physics scene contains a physics world that can be simulated independently of any other physics world. Having a large number of worlds is not in of itself a performance issue because it will only occupy memory and not perform any work unless it is simulated. | Solver World Count | No  
**Simulation Count** | The number of times all physics scene were simulated either by Unity automatically, by calling [Physics2D.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics2D.Simulate.html) or by directly calling [PhysicsScene2D.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene2D.Simulate.html). | Solver Simulation Count | No  
**Discrete Islands** | An island is a connected graph of bodies connected via mutual joints or mutual contacts. Note that [Static](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyType2D.Static.html) body types do not connect islands. The number of contact islands solved when handling the discrete solving step. | Solver Discrete Islands | No  
**Continuous Islands** | An island is a connected graph of bodies connected via mutual joints or mutual contacts. Note that Static body types do not connect islands. This is the number of islands solved when handling the continuous solving step. Solving continuous islands is an extremely expensive process and involves multiple iterations that require islands to be regenerated and reprocessed so this should be kept to a minimum. Only a [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) with a [Continuous](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CollisionDetectionMode2D.Continuous.html) collision detection mode will result in this additional continuous island being formed and processed. | Solver Continuous Islands | No  
### Transform Sync
**Statistic** | **Description** | **Corresponding Profiler Counter (exact name)** | **Available in Release Players?**  
---|---|---|---  
**Sync Calls** | The total number of Transform sync calls that were called in this frame. A Transform sync (known as a Transform Read) involves checking to see if any Transforms have changed and if so, the Transform poses are read and cause any [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) or [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) to be updated. Transforms should not be changed when using physics components however sometimes this is necessary but should be avoided due to potential performance issues if performing too many. Any movements should be performed by using the Rigidbody2D API.  
  
The physics system will perform a single Transform sync as the first part of performing a simulation step so this will always be at least one if a simulation occurred (see [Simulation Count](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/physics-profiler/physics-2d-profiler-module-reference.html#SimCount) above). The physics system will also perform a single Transform sync per-frame if it is handling any Rigidbody2D interpolation.  
  
Additional calls are shown if either [Physics2D.AutoSyncTransforms](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics2D-autoSyncTransforms.html) is active (inactive by default) or if [Physics2D.SyncTransforms](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics2D.SyncTransforms.html) is called although both of these should be avoided as they can both have a severe impact on performance. | Total Transform Sync Calls | No  
**Sync Bodies** | The number of Rigidbody2D that were affected by a Transform sync. This should be kept to a minimum, preferably zero. | Transform Sync Bodies | No  
**Sync Colliders** | The number of Collider2D that were affected by a Transform sync. This should be kept to a minimum, preferably zero. | Transform Sync Colliders | No  
**Parent Sync Bodies** | The number of Rigidbody2D that were affected by a Transform sync caused by reparenting a Transform.. This should be kept to a minimum, preferably zero. | Transform Parent Sync Bodies | No  
**Parent Sync Colliders** | The number of Collider2D that were affected by a Transform sync caused by reparenting a Transform. This should be kept to a minimum, preferably zero. | Transform Parent Sync Colliders | No

---|---|---|---  
**Total** | The total number of any [Joint2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.html) that were present in this frame. Solving joints can become expensive so these should be kept to a minimum. | Total Joints | No  
### Timings
**Note** : All timings are summed over all physics worlds (see [World Count](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/physics-profiler/physics-2d-profiler-module-reference.html#WorldCount)). The number of times any timing was sampled is shown in square brackets after the timing itself. Effectively the timing can be divided by the **World Count** value to give an average time.
**Statistic** | **Description** | **Corresponding Profiler Counter (exact name)** | **Available in Release Players?**  
---|---|---|---  
**Sim** | The total amount of time spent handling a full simulation step. This can be called by Unity automatically, by calling [Physics2D.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics2D.Simulate.html) or by directly calling [PhysicsScene2D.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene2D.Simulate.html). This time includes all the stages involved in completing a simulation step including Transform Sync (read), Calculating Contacts, Integration, Solving Contacts and Joints, Transform Write and Contact Callbacks. | N/A | N/A  
**Sync** | The total amount of time spent processing Transform Sync (see [Sync Calls](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/physics-profiler/physics-2d-profiler-module-reference.html#SyncCalls)). | N/A | N/A  
**Step** | The total amount of time spent processing simulation steps. This time includes only the core stages involved in completing a simulation step including Calculating Contacts, Integration, Solving Contacts and Joints. | N/A | N/A  
**Write** | The total amount of time spent processing Transform write. This happens during the end of the simulation step where body poses are read and written back to the Transform system. | N/A | N/A  
**Callbacks** | The total amount of time spent processing all callbacks (see [Total Callbacks](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/physics-profiler/physics-2d-profiler-module-reference.html#TotalCallbacks)). | N/A | N/A
