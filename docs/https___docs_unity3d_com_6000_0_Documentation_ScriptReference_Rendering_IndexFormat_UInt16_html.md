### Description
16 bit mesh index buffer format.
This format supports meshes with up to 65535 vertices.  
  
**Note:** the maximum possible vertex index (for example, 0xFFFF for a 16 bit index format) might not be usable. Some graphics APIs and GPUs skip rendering triangles with maximum vertex indices.
