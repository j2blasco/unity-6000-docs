timeout; 
### Description
The number of seconds after which UnityWebRequest attempts to abort the request if no response is received.
The default value is `0` which means no timeout is applied and UnityWebRequest will wait until the response is received.  
  
When the response takes longer than the value specified in `timeout`, [UnityWebRequest.error](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest-error.html) returns `Request timeout` message.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine.Networking;  
  
// Ask the website to deliver an image that is very large.
// Set the download to take more than 60 seconds. This causes
// the "request timeout" error message.  
  
public class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        StartCoroutine(GetText());
    }  
  
    IEnumerator GetText()
    {
        using UnityWebRequest[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) www = UnityWebRequest.Get[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.Get.html)("https://my-website.com/verylargeimage.jpg");  
  
        // Set the timeout to 60 seconds.
        // Abort the request if the image doesn't download within the specified timeout.
        www.timeout = 60;
        yield return www.SendWebRequest();  
  
        if (www.result != UnityWebRequest.Result.Success[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.Result.Success.html))
        {
            Debug.LogError[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.LogError.html)(www.error);
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("image arrived");
        }
    }
}
