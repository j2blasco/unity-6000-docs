Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) view to paint tiles directly in the **Scene view** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SceneView).


### Changes introduced in 2023.1
  * Added API to allow **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) to get and set references to ScriptableObjects.
  * Added Brush Picks to the Tile Palette window.
  * Added options to create WhiteBox Tile Palettes.
  * Added preference option to Tile Palette Preferences for users to choose where they want to position their mouse cursor when painting on **Tilemaps** A GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid overlay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tilemaps/work-with-tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Tilemap) with Z Position.
  * Added Sample for Custom Geometry Generation and Vertex Colors.
  * Added Sprite/SpriteShape/TilemapRenderer as mask sources for SpriteMask.
  * Added SRP Batching for 2D Renderers and Particle Renderer to support URP.
  * Added support for **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) frustum culling to Inverse **Kinematics** The geometry that describes the position and orientation of a character’s joints and bodies. Used by inverse kinematics to control character movement.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#kinematics) Manager 2D.
  * Enabled opening Sprite Editor Window from SpriteRenderer **inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector) to edit the Sprite that is assigned to the SpriteRenderer.
  * Enabled ScriptablePacker to add custom packing algorithm for SpriteAtlas.
  * Added a `Rigidbody2D.Slide` method which allows a Rigidbody2D to move with a specific velocity over a specific integration time and perform various slide, gravity, slip, direction-change, and surface-anchoring behaviors automatically. This method works on all **body types** Defines a fixed behavior for a 2D Rigidbody. Can be Dynamic (the body moves under simulation and is affected by forces like gravity), Kinematic (the body moves under simulation, but and isn’t affected by forces like gravity) or Static (the body doesn’t move under simulation). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/rigidbody/introduction-to-rigidbody-2d.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#BodyType), including Static bodies. It can simply calculate a new position, change the Rigidbody2D position immediately (supports interpolation), or defer the movement by automatically calling `Rigidbody2D.MovePosition()`. This feature makes **Character Controllers** A simple, capsule-shaped collider component with specialized features for behaving as a character in a game. Unlike true collider components, a Rigidbody is not needed and the momentum effects are not realistic. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-CharacterController.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#CharacterController) easier to create.

## Entities
### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview
  * Added serialization support for `UnityObjectRef<>` to enable unmanaged references to Unity assets. For example, instead of a Texture on a managed IComponentData, you can have a `UnityObjectRef<Texture>` on an unmanaged `IComponentData`.
  * The Create menu adds the following Type templates: 
    * `IComponentData`
    * `ISystem`
    * `IJobEntity`
    * Baker
  * Changed the way that entities are stored in preparation for the consolidation of entities and GameObject workflows. Entity IDs are now globally unique and you can now move them efficiently from one entities world to another. This does not impact ECS workflows in Unity 6.0, but it does disambiguate debugging by always showing exact entities. 
  * Applied the following fixes to the entities Hierarchy window: 
    * You can select entities and systems within the hierarchy.
    * Fixed an invalid range check that failed after you removed entities from the hierarchy view in valid use cases.
    * Stopped the entities hierarchy from throwing exceptions when entities are destroyed.
    * The entities hierarchy now removes all nodes of a scene and subscenes when the scene is unloaded.
    * An exception is no longer thrown when you enter a **prefab** An asset type that allows you to store a GameObject complete with components and properties. The prefab acts as a template from which you can create new object instances in the scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Prefabs.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Prefab) from the entities hierarchy.
  * Improved the performance of baking and the creation of archetypes and entity queries in worlds with a large number of existing types. 
  * Improved the performance of LocalToWorld systems and non-dirty hierarchies.
  * Fixed an issue where an `EntityQuery` using `WithNone<T>` on an enable component wasn’t inserting a necessary job dependency.
  * `EntityQuery` singleton methods now correctly handle cases where the query contains enableable components.
  * Fixed memory leak issues, like ones affecting world deserialization and content delivery.
  * Fixed breakpoints in jobs defined in systems with `System.API`.


## Graphics
### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0
Moved Unity 6.0 documentation for the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP) to the [Unity Engine](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/index.html) manual. For example, documentation about lighting in URP is now in the [Lighting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/lighting-landing.html) section of the manual.
### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview
  * Added support for indirect Dispatch Rays (part of DXR 1.1). The method is similar to `RayTracingShader.Dispatch`, but the three dispatch dimensions are retrieved from a GraphicsBuffer. Added `RayTracingShader.DispatchIndirect` and a new `CommandBuffer.DispatchRays` signature. Added `SystemInfo.supportsIndirectDispatchRays` capability status.
  * Added the [GPU Resident Drawer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/gpu-resident-drawer.html), which automatically uses the `BatchRendererGroup` API to draw GameObjects with GPU instancing. This reduces the number of draw calls and frees CPU processing time.
  * Added support for SpeedTree GameObjects to the GPU Resident Drawer.
  * Added support for [GPU occlusion culling of instances](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/gpu-culling.html) if they’re compatible with the GPU Resident Drawer, including culling of small meshes.
  * Adding a new per-batch layer filtering setting for the `BatchRendererGroup` API. You can use this setting to cull specific batches.
  * Optimized CPU performance of the Volume framework in URP and HDRP, to improve efficiency on low-end hardware and allow more precise control over quality settings.
  * Added a **Force No Crunch** texture compression setting in **Build Profiles** > **Asset Import Overrides** , which forces all textures to disable crunch compression and re-import.
  * Added an `IRenderPipelineResources` interface that allows you to [add new settings groups in the Graphics Settings window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@17.0/manual/add-custom-graphics-settings.html). Updated the default `IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings` Inspector to trigger notifications when a value in Graphics Settings is modified, and added a custom menu in `IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings`.
  * Added UI Toolkit support for `CustomPostProcessOrder`.
  * Added the option to cache render graph system compilation for both URP and HDRP.


### Changes introduced in 2023.2
  * Unity 2023.2 introduces optimizations to SkinnedMeshRenderers across all supported platforms. These optimizations aim to batch compute **skinning** The process of binding bone joints to the vertices of a character’s mesh or ‘skin’. Performed with an external tool, such as Blender or Autodesk Maya. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingHumanoidChars.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Skinning) and blendshape dispatches. This can increase the amount of vertices deformed in parallel and improve the GPU performance of character and skinned mesh rendering.
  * The Progressive GPU **Lightmapper** A tool in Unity that bakes lightmaps according to the arrangement of lights and geometry in your scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Lightmapper) is now out of preview and fully supported. For more information, refer to [Select the CPU or GPU for baking](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/progressive-lightmapper.html).
  * Added APIs to [move Light Probe positions at runtime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightProbes-Moving.html).
  * Removed the **Auto Generate** setting in the Lighting window. Related APIs are now obsolete. To check **lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that contains the effects of light sources on static objects in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the effect of lighting. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Lightmap) while you’re editing, you can now select a [Debug Draw Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GIVis.html) and set **Lighting Data** to **Preview**. This displays a preview of the baked lighting. The preview lightmaps are non-destructive, and you can use them after you’ve baked the scene.
  * Added `BatchCullingContext.cullingFlags` to specify whether to cull lightmapped shadow casters.
  * Added `rendererPriority` support for `BatchRendererGroup`.
  * Added support for building **ray tracing** The process of generating an image by tracing out rays from the Camera through each pixel and recording the color contribution at the hit point. This is an alternative to rasterization. raytracing  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Raytracing) acceleration structures asynchronously on a compute queue. AsyncCompute CommandBuffers can now run `CommandBuffer.BuildRayTracingAccelerationStructure` commands. Added support for `RayTracingAccelerationStructure` to RenderGraph and Render Graph Viewer.
  * Enabled exposing raytracing acceleration structure build flags for balancing build times versus ray tracing speed and memory consumption on the GPU. You can customize flags from C# when creating and building a `RayTracingAccelerationStructure`, or via the Renderer settings.
  * Added mipmap limit support and mipmap stripping support for Texture2DArrays.
  * Added support for providing tiled EXR images to LoadImage.
  * Added Native Render Pass support for DX12.
  * Added support for GPU batched skinning for D3D12 (Windows and XBox platforms).
  * Added the Custom Vertex Streams feature for particle trails.
  * Added `BakeTexture` and `BakeTrailsTexture` scripting methods.


### Changes introduced in 2023.1
  * Introduced a new graphics jobs threading mode called **Split Graphics Jobs** to reduce unnecessary start and end of frame synchronization between the main and native graphics job threads.
  * Introduced the new LightBaker v1.0 backend for manual lighting bakes, which makes [baking](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Lightmapping-landing.html) more predictable and stable. Manual bakes no longer restart if you change the scene during baking, so the Editor is more responsive during baking. If you bake with the GPU backend, you can use a Baking Profile to select the tradeoff between performance and GPU memory usage.
  * Added screen space [lens flares](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/visual-effects-lens-flares.html)A component that simulates the effect of lights refracting inside a camera lens. Use a Lens Flare to represent very bright lights or add atmosphere to your scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-LensFlare.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#LensFlare) that you can generate from all lights visible on the screen (direct, indirect, emissive surfaces, specular highlights) in just a few clicks with a single **post-processing** A process that improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PostProcessingOverview.html) post processing, postprocessing, postprocess  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#post-processing) volume. These lens flares are compatible with both HDRP and URP. This feature complements the Lens Flare (SRP) component, which gives you more advanced artistic control over lens flares from lights, but which you can only use on predefined light sources (directional, point and spot lights), and can only manually associate with each one.
  * [Dynamic shader variant loading](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-loading.html#dynamicloading) provides additional user control over shader loading behavior and memory usage. This optimization enables the streaming of shader data chunks into memory, and eviction of shader data that is no longer needed at runtime, based on a user controlled memory budget. This allows to significantly reduce shader memory usage on platforms with limited memory budgets.
  * Added asynchronous compilation of pipeline state objects for [shader warmup](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-prewarm.html).
  * Added DirectX Raytracing (DXR) 1.1 support in compute shaders. Added the following APIs: `SystemInfo.supportsInlineRayTracing`, `SystemInfo.supportsRayTracingShaders`, `ComputeShader.SetRayTracingAccelerationStructure`, and `CommandBuffer.SetRayTracingAccelerationStructure`(ComputeShader, …).
  * Added `#pragma require inlineraytracing` to compute shaders.
  * Added new `RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstance` signature that allows adding mesh instances to the acceleration structure for GPU ray tracing. This is the equivalent of `Graphics.RenderMesh` from the **rasterization** The process of generating an image by calculating pixels for each polygon or triangle in the geometry. This is an alternative to ray tracing.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Rasterization) pipeline.
  * Added foveated rendering support for D3D12/Vulkan.
  * Added foveated rendering support for Metal.
  * Added support for loading EXR data through `ImageConversion.LoadImage()`.
  * Added support for VK_EXT_debug_utils on Vulkan platforms.
  * Added mipmap limit groups, for more fine-grained configurability over the single value that applies to all mipmapped Texture2D assets. For more information, refer to [Quality settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-QualitySettings.html).
  * Enabled Ray Tracing Support in Terrain settings by default for new Terrains.
  * Implemented `ScriptableRenderContext.CullShadowCasters` API to kick theBatchRendererGroup culling jobs earlier in URP and HDRP.
  * Added standardized shader variant keywords for native 16-bit shader types, and wave operations. For more information, refer to [Set a shader to require a shader model or GPU feature](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SL-ShaderCompileTargets.html).
  * Added a debug view to visualize probe sampling in Adaptive Probe Volumes. For more information, refer to [Display Adaptive Probe Volumes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/probevolumes-showandadjust.html).
  * Merged the [Adaptive Probe Volume window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/lighting-window.html#ProbeVolumes) with the Lighting window.


### URP
For a complete description of new features and improvements in URP, refer to [What’s new in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@17.0/manual/whats-new/urp-whats-new.html). 
#### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview
  * Added the 8192x8192 option to Shadow texture resolution for the Main Light and Additional Lights.
  * Added the [camera history API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@17.0/api/UnityEngine.Rendering.Universal.UniversalCameraHistory.html) which lets you access per-camera history textures and use them in custom render passes. History textures are the color and depth textures that Unity rendered for each camera in previous frames.
  * Added Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) Lighting Scenario Blending to URP.
  * Added a [new config package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/URP-Config-Package.html) that lets you override the maximum number of visible lights.
  * Added the [Render Graph Viewer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/render-graph-viewer-reference.html) window. This tool lets you visualize how render passes use frame resources, and debug the rendering process.
  * The [Rendering Debugger](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/features/rendering-debugger.html) now contains a Mipmap Streaming section. This section lets you inspect the texture streaming activity.
  * Added C# script templates to create [custom post-processing effects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/post-processing/custom-post-processing-with-volume.html) that use a volume component.
  * Added APV sky occlusion support for URP.
  * Added support for Spatial Temporal Post-Processing (STP) upscaling.
  * The new [render graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/render-graph.html) system improves the way you customize and maintain the render pipeline. The system reduces the amount of memory URP uses and makes memory management more efficient. 
  * This URP version implements the [Alpha Processing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/universalrp-asset.html#post-processing) setting. If you enable this setting, URP renders the post-processing output into a **render texture** A special type of Texture that is created and updated at runtime. To use them, first create a new Render Texture and designate one of your Cameras to render into it. Then you can use the Render Texture in a Material just like a regular Texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-RenderTexture.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#RenderTexture) with an alpha channel. In previous versions, URP discarded the alpha channel by replacing alpha values with 1.


#### Changes introduced in 2023.2
  * Added cross-platform **HDR** high dynamic range  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#HDR) display support. The Editor and built Players now provide full HDR tone mapping and display support, across all rendering pipelines and platforms that support HDR, including mobile and XR.
  * Added per-vertex quality levels for indirect lighting from Probe Volumes so that URP renders lit environments more efficiently. On mobile platforms URP doesn’t support Lighting Scenario blending or Lighting Normalization for **Reflection Probes** A rendering component that captures a spherical view of its surroundings in all directions, rather like a camera. The captured image is then stored as a Cubemap that can be used by objects with reflective materials. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ReflectionProbe.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#ReflectionProbe).
  * Added the **Camera And Objects** option in the Motion Blur volume component. The option uses motion vectors to blur objects that move faster than the camera’s exposure time.
  * Added support for additional directional light cookies.
  * Added the **Default Volume Profile** field to URP Global Settings.
  * Added the **Volume Profile** field to the Universal Render Pipeline Asset.
  * Added alembic velocity motion vector support for URP materials.
  * Added automatic time-based motion vector generation for Shader Graph shaders with vertex animation based only on the **Time** node.
  * Added support for XR rendering and orthographic projection cameras to Forward+ **rendering path** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#RenderingPath).
  * Added support for foveated rendering in the Forward+ rendering path.


#### Changes introduced in 2023.1
  * Added [temporal anti-aliasing (TAA)](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/anti-aliasing.html#taa) support. The feature is not compatible with MSAA, **Dynamic Resolution** A Camera setting that allows you to dynamically scale individual render targets to reduce workload on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/DynamicResolution-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#dynamicresolution), or Camera stacking. The feature supports only fixed resolution, and does not support temporal upsampling.
  * Added support for [High Dynamic Range (HDR) output](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/post-processing/hdr-output.html).
  * Added the [Detailed Stats](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/features/rendering-debugger-reference.html#detailed-stats) section to URP Rendering Debugger.
  * Ported all URP passes to use the [RasterCommandBuffer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@17.0/api/UnityEngine.Rendering.RasterCommandBuffer.html) API.
  * Added the **AO Method** property to **SSAO** settings where you can select the options Interleaved Gradient Noise or Blue Noise.
  * Added the **Blur Quality** property to **SSAO** settings where you can select the options High (Bilateral), Medium (Gaussian), or Low (Single-Pass Kawase).
  * Added the Falloff field to SSAO settings to control the distance from the camera where the AO effect is applied.
  * Added the clustered reflection probe support to the URP Forward+ rendering path. This enables the use of more than two reflection probes per object, allows Unity to skip per-object culling of lights and reflection probes, and enables Entities Graphics and procedural draws to make use of reflection probes.
  * Added the [low-code Custom Post Processing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/post-processing/post-processing-custom-effect-low-code.html) feature in URP.
  * Added Decal support to render graph API.
  * Added render graph API support to URP post-processing effects.
  * Added support for shadow rendering to **2D objects** A 2D GameObject such as a tilemap or sprite. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Unity2D.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#2DObject), such as sprites, **colliders** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collider), sprite shape, and 2D animation.
  * Added soft shadow rendering to shadow-casting 2D lights.
  * Added a limited support of Probe Volumes, with no interpolation of lighting data sets, and limited performance on lower-end hardware.
  * Improved FXAA quality. The new implementation provides better edge anti-aliasing (removing odd edge artifacts seen with the previous implementation) and better retention of texture quality. The improvement does not affect performance. The output quality is now comparable to the low and medium SMAA presets but with better performance.


### HDRP
For a complete description of new features and improvements in URP, refer to [What’s new in HDRP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@17.0/manual/whats-new-17.html).
#### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview
  * Added support for overriding material properties such as smoothness, albedo, and **normal maps** A type of Bump Map texture that allows you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Normalmap) on all materials to facilitate material and lighting debugging. The material override feature in HDRP is available through the Rendering Debugger’s Lighting panel when rendering through the path tracer pipeline.
  * Added the Sky Occlusion feature to Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV), to allow time of day with static probe volumes.
  * Disabled storing of baked data as Streaming Asset in Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) to make it compatible with Asset Bundles and Addressables.
  * Added AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR2) Unity script bindings and HDRP integration.
  * Improved on existing Mipmap Streaming debug views and added more. The current offering in HDRP is consistent with what URP offers.
  * Added support for Spatial Temporal Post-Processing (STP) upscaling solution.


#### Changes introduced in 2023.2
  * Added HDRP path tracer support for Decals projectors. The path tracer does not support emission from decals.
  * Added the ability to stream Probe Volume data from disk at runtime. You can enable or disable disk streaming for different quality levels.
  * Made HDRP Shader Graph decals compatible with transparent objects. This means you can use decals created with Shader Graph to affect transparent objects to build procedural effects like rain drops, ripples, custom engravings, dirt effects on glass.
  * Added a night sky with stars and celestial bodies to the HDRP physical sky.
  * Added a Shader Graph output for the physically based sky and added controls to create a moon.
  * Added visualization of async compute passes and their synchronization points to the Render Graph Viewer.
  * Added beer shadow maps for volumetric clouds.
  * Added a Volume Profile field to HD Render Pipeline Asset.
  * Added a material type for thin objects with colored transmission.

  * Added the Global Pass API that you can use to inject custom passes in the render pipeline without any GameObjects in a scene.
  * Added the volumetric fog fullscreen debug mode output for Arbitrary Output Variables (AOV).
  * Added Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) ability to stream data directly from the disk. This feature is only available on devices with compute shader compatibility.
  * Added the ability to use the baking API to bake Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) independently from lightmaps or reflection probes.


#### Changes introduced in 2023.1
  * Light Layers and Decal Layers are now managed in similar ways in both HDRP and URP. In HDRP they now share the first 16 Rendering Layers, instead of using 8 separate bits each. Additionally, a new option in the HDRP Asset allows access to a full screen buffer that contains the Rendering Layers Masks of rendered Objects. HDRP can sample that buffer from the ShaderGraph through the HD Sample Buffer node, and use it to implement custom effects, like outlining objects on a specific rendering layer.
  * All Ray Tracing HDRP features (raytraced shadows, reflections, AO, global illumination, path tracing, recursive rendering,…) are officially out of experimental in Unity 2023.1.0.
  * Added a foam system to the HDRP Water System.
  * Probe Volumes are out of experimental. Revamped the control interface to provide a better experience when you place Probe Volumes, light dynamic objects and some static objects, stream data from GPU memory, interpolate lighting data sets, and work with volumetric fog and particles.
  * Added a third level of noise for volumetric clouds.
  * Added Generic Rendering Layer mode support.
  * Added [High Quality Line Rendering](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@15.0/manual/Override-High-Quality-Lines.html) which unlocks improved performance and image quality for line topology.
  * Added the ability to [compute the thickness of an object](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@17.0/manual/Compute-Thickness.html#:~:text=HDRP%20can%20use%20the%20optical,use%20subsurface%20scattering%20or%20refraction.).
  * Added improvements to the SSS lighting model.
  * Added Ray Tracing Terrain support for HDRP.
  * Added raytraced shadows for Pyramid and Box shaped Spot Lights.
  * Added the Ray Tracing Light Cluster to Path Tracer.
  * Added volumetric material support for local volumetric fog volumes.
  * Exposed Material Type in materials using the Lit Shader Graph.
  * Improved stripping of unused features.
  * **Specular color** The color of a specular highlight.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#specularcolor) on HDRP/Lit and HDRP/StackLit below 2% can be used to suppress specular lighting completely when “Specular Fade” is enabled.
  * Improved the water rendering system in the following ways: 
    * Added functionality to Water Mask so it dynamically removes water from inside a boat or in a cave in the middle of an island.
    * Modified the water deformer to dynamically deform water locally. For example, to deform water around a moving ship, deform waves near shores, or deform water in a vortex.
    * Added flow maps to create local currents, to manage surface waves that follow currents, and the water query API to allow objects to drift.
    * Added a water line to manage the transition for cameras that are half underwater.
    * Improved visual quality of water.
    * Improved the UX of the water system.
  * Added an extra optional pass to compute thickness of transparent objects at runtime to get more accurate refraction and transparency rendering.
  * Improved visual quality when using temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) with two new options to perform sharpening. The first option is a post-process pass that offers higher quality sharpening, control over the amount of sharpening, and an option to reduce possible ringing artifacts. The second option is to run Contrast Adaptive Sharpening from AMD FidelityFX.
  * Specular light can now be completely faded when using a specular color workflow using the HDRP/Lit and HDRP/StackLit shaders by toggling a new option that can be found in the HDRP Global Settings under Miscellaneous/Specular Fade.
  * Added Rendering Layers support to Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) to address light leaking issues in interior/exterior scenarios.
  * Added a new Leak Reduction Mode for Adaptive Probe Volume sampling called ‘Quality’, which ensures that no invalid probes are sampled.
  * Implemented an anti-seam mechanism to smooth transitions between multiple subdivision levels in Adaptive Probe Volumes.


## Multiplayer
Unity 6.0 Multiplayer features are designed to simplify and accelerate multiplayer game development in a way that prepares you for future integration with Multiplayer Services and supports the growth of engaged player communities over time.

#### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview
  * Added Distributed Authority mode in Netcode for GameObjects clients have distributed ownership of or authority over spawned Netcode objects during a game session. With Distributed Authority, the clients have the governed authority to spawn network objects which is announced to the cloud state service and conveys state updates to all connected clients. A highly optimized cloud state service maintains the overall state of a network session between clients.
  * Added a new RPC attribute that can perform the functions of both Server and Client RPCs, as well as enabling client-to-client RPCs.
  * Added many utility methods, which include `NetworkManager.OnConnectionEvent`, `-ServerIsHost`, `-InstantiateAndSpawn`, and more.


#### Changes introduced in Unity 2023.2
  * Added the **Refresh In-Scene Prefab Instances** option in the Network Object component context menu. Use this property to update the `GlobalObjectIdHash` value for prefab instances in the scene that existed before they had a `NetworkObject` component. This property affects all scenes included in the build list.
  * Added the `NetworkManager` methods `SetPeerMTU` and `GetPeerMTU` to give full control over Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) sizes. Use this for custom protocols in Netcode for GameObjects.
  * Improved network prefab identification generation (for example, `GlobalObjectIdHash`) to fix issues where Unity assigned invalid values.
  * Improved the serialization API and codegen pipelines in the following ways: 
    * Added the `GenerateSerializationForTypeAttribute` method that you can apply to any class or method to ensure the specific type is included in the codegen serialization process.
    * Added the `GenerateSerializationForGenericParameterAttribute` method that you can use to include generic type(s) wrapped by a `NetworkVariable` type in the codegen process.
    * Exposed additional `NetworkVariableSerialization` methods to improve custom `NetworkVariable` creation without any boxing cost. You can use the `NetworkVariableBase.MarkNetworkBehaviourDirty` method to mark NetworkVariables as dirty.
  * RPCs in generic `NetworkBehaviour` types can now serialize parameters of the class’s generic types.
  * Improved support for 32-bit ARMv7 in Netcode.
  * Added additional `NetworkManager` events `OnServerStarted`, `OnServerStopped`, `OnClientStarted`, and `OnClientStopped` to provide better notification of the `NetworkManager` initialization process.

  * `Added BatchScaleImportanceDelegate`, a new version of the importance scaling function that works in batches. It is not required to set both the ScaleImportance and the BatchScaleImportance function pointers. If the BatchScaleImportance is set, it is the preferred.


## Package Manager
### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview
Improved the behavior of [Project manifest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html)Each Unity project has a _project manifest_ , which acts as an entry point for the Package Manager. This file must be available in the `<project>/Packages` directory. The Package Manager uses it to configure many things, including a list of dependencies for that project, as well as any package repository to query for packages. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Projectmanifest) files by repopulating them with default dependencies if the files are empty or full of whitespace.
### Changes introduced in 2023.1
  * Added functionality to track assets imported from an Asset Store package: 
    * Added an **Imported Assets** tab in the [package details view](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-details.html) (My Assets) to visualize imported assets.
    * Added a **Remove** button and window for Asset Store packages, to selectively remove imported assets.
  * Enhanced the user experience for [deprecated packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/pack-deprecated.html). The Unity Editor notifies users at startup if their project has any deprecated packages. Updated the Package Manager window to identify two types of package deprecation: 
    * Packages that reach their end of life and are no longer supported in the given Editor.
    * A specific version of a package marked as deprecated.
  * Added **Web3** as a category in the [Filters](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-filter2.html) menu when viewing My Assets.
  * Changed the default sorting in the My Assets view to **Purchased date** , to match the default sort method in Asset Store.

    * Improved the flow for managing packages in the **My Assets** context by streamlining the action buttons in the details panel. The most common action appears as the default action in a menu button, with additional actions listed in the menu. Also added an **In Project** label to clearly indicate when an Asset Store package is already imported into your project and up-to-date.
    * Updated the label of the **Import** button when viewing an Asset Store package. After you [download an updated Asset Store package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-update2.html), the main action button label is **Import update #.# to project** , so it’s clear that you need to import the update to your project.
    * Updated the behavior of the [Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-docs.html#Editor) link for packages that you installed from a registry. You can now right-click the link and choose to **Open in browser** or **Open locally**.
    * Added a button to sign in with your Unity ID when you’re logged out and try to view the details of an Asset Store package.
  * Other enhancements: 
    * Updated the values in the [Filters](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-filter2.html) menu when you’re viewing the My Assets context.
    * Updated the label for the [Filters](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-filter2.html) control so it shows the selected value rather than the parent category.

## Test Framework
### Changes introduced in 2023.2
  * Enabled retrying and repeating tests based on test level. Soon as the test finishes running its first iteration, the Editor now retries or repeats the test. Pass the command line arguments to the Editor to: 
    * Repeat x runs the test x amount of times or until it fails. This is useful for testing unstable tests.
    * Retry x if a test fails. This run the test x amount of times or until it succeeds.
  * You can now run the tests in a randomized order, by using the Editor command line new argument `-randomOrderSeed x`, where `x` is an integer different from 0. If a new test is added to the project, the Test Framework keeps the random order passing the same seed, and places the new test in the random list accordingly.
  * Added `TestFileReferences.json` to generate on a build step of the player, so that Test runners can consume it to enrich data for the run step.
  * The UTF version now automatically updates for SRP tests.


## Version Control
### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0
  * Added an option to delete non-empty branches that you haven’t merged anywhere.
  * Added a setting to automatically add any new files to source control.


### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview
Added a new tab view to list and manage locks in the Version Control feature of Unity.
### Changes introduced in 2023.2
Added a project option to support tracking packages that exist on disk outside of the project’s root folder.
### Changes introduced in 2023.1
  * Added a new Branch Name column in the Changesets view.
  * Added changelist related options to pending changes context menu.
  * Added option to enable changelists and display them in pending changes tab.


## Visual Scripting
### Changes introduced in 2023.1
  * Added a confirmation dialog when you reset assemblies and types in **Project settings** A broad collection of settings which allow you to configure how Physics, Audio, Networking, Graphics, Input and many other areas of your project behave. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/comp-ManagerGroup.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#ProjectSettings).
  * Added a confirmation dialog when you reset Project settings and Editor preferences.
  * Added Sticky Notes for ScriptGraph and StateGraph.
  * Added support for parameter renaming in code used by API nodes.
  * Added support for nodes to have a button which triggers a custom action in their Inspector description.
  * Added support to convert nodes with an unknown type to placeholder nodes. These nodes return to normal when their original type is redefined, or if you replace the node.


## VFX Graph
### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview
  * Improved the Shader Graph Cross Pipeline workflow.
  * You can now handle built-in and custom attributes from the blackboard panel.
  * Allowed instanced rendering of VFX that have exposed textures or graphic buffers.
  * Strips now support the “Indirect draw” option. “Indirect draw” renders only the particles that are active, instead of full capacity.
  * Added support for per-particle sorting in strips.
  * Added new profiling/debugging panels in the VFX window.
  * Added Camera Buffer Access support in VFX with URP.
  * Support of `ShaderKeyword` declared in Shader Graph.
  * Reworked Flipbook player block.
  * Added **collision** A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collision) events that allow specific processes upon contact.
  * The following improvements have been made to shortcuts in VFX Graph: 
    * Registered the shortcuts in the global Unity Shortcut window.
    * Synced shortcuts with ShaderGraph where possible.
    * Added new shortcuts.
  * Added particle count readback for strips, which also allows strips to go to sleep state.
  * Enabled Frustum Culling for strips.


### Changes introduced in 2023.2
  * Added VFX Graph assets with a predefined effect to the template window. You can use these templates as a starting point for your own effects.
  * Added Custom HLSL blocks and operators. Custom HLSL nodes let you execute your own code during particle simulation. You can use an operator for horizontal flow or a block for vertical flow in the VFX Graph context.
  * Added URP Decals with VFX Graph. URP Lit decal output are now supported in VFX Graph, making it possible to create stunning decal effects on URP that matches correctly your scene lighting and materials
  * Added lighting for Shader Graph smoke effects in HDRP and URP. This means that you can create custom smoke shaders that use six-way lighting in lit shaders.
  * Extended the Camera Depth and Color buffer behavior in URP. This means you can use the **depth buffer** A memory store that holds the z-value depth of each pixel in an image, where the z-value is the depth for each rendered pixel from the projection plane. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-RenderTexture.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#depthbuffer) for depth-based collisions or sample the color buffer to create custom effects.
  * Added support for motion vectors in URP.
  * Added support for motion vectors with Shader Graph.
  * Added the ability to use VFX Graph’s Shade Graph integration to use the material variant workflow to override settings in the VFX Output.
  * Enabled VFX instancing with exposed textures, meshes, or graphic buffers.


### Changes introduced in 2023.1
  * Added a new output to modify the volumetric fog of HDRP.
  * Added VFX integration in Ray Tracing.
  * Fixed the six-way lighting and lightmap remapping options.
  * Optimized CPU and GPU VFX runtime in VFX Instancing.
