## Declaration
public static [Awaitable](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Awaitable.html) EndOfFrameAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
cancellationToken | Optional cancellation token used to signal cancellation.  
### Description
Resumes execution after all Unity subsystems have run for the current frame.
**Note:** This method can only be called from the main thread and always completes on main thread. Also, in Editor, this awaitable is incompatible with BatchMode and requires the game to be in play mode (in edit mode, it will never complete).
