AdditionalLibrariesBuildGradleFiles; 
### Description
A representation of the `build.gradle` files that were added to plugins (libraries) that didn't have a `build.gradle` file.
Files are located in `unityLibrary/{pluginName}/build.gradle`.  
  
If you have a plugin called `myLibrary` that doesn't contain `build.gradle` file, the file will be generated and placed in `unityLibrary/mylibrary.androidlib/build.gradle`. You can use this path to access the file object in this dictionary.
```
using System.IO;
using UnityEditor.Android;
using Unity.Android.Gradle[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Android.Gradle.html);  
  
public class ModifyProjectScript : AndroidProjectFilesModifier[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Android.AndroidProjectFilesModifier.html)
{
    public override void OnModifyAndroidProjectFiles(AndroidProjectFiles[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Android.AndroidProjectFiles.html) projectFiles)
    {
        // Add a Google() repository to a build.gradle file in mylibrary.androidlib library
        var myLibraryBuildGradle = projectFiles.AdditionalLibrariesBuildGradleFiles[Path.Combine("unityLibrary", "mylibrary.androidlib", "build.gradle")];
        myLibraryBuildGradle.Repositories.AddRepository(Repositories.Google[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Android.Gradle.Repositories.Google.html));
    }
