# Share information about a rendering event
To help you share information for a particular event, the Frame Debugger window can copy the information in the user interface to the clipboard. It can copy information for a single property, for all the properties in a properties section, or for an entire event. This means you donâ€™t need to take one or multiple screenshots to share the results of a frame capture. 
To copy a single property and its values to the clipboard, right-click the property and select **Copy Property**.
To copy all the properties and their values from a properties section, right-click the properties section header and select **Copy** **All <property type> Properties**.
To copy all the information from the rendering event, right-click the event header and select **Copy** **Event Info**.
