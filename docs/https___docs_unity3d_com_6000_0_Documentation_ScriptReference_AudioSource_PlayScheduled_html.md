## Declaration
public void PlayScheduled(double time); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
time | Time in seconds on the absolute time-line that AudioSettings.dspTime refers to for when the sound should start playing.  
### Description
Plays the [clip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioSource-clip.html) at a specific time on the absolute time-line that AudioSettings.dspTime reads from.
This is the preferred way to stitch AudioClips in music players because it is independent of the frame rate and gives the audio system enough time to prepare the playback of the sound to fetch it from media where the opening and buffering takes a lot of time (streams) without causing sudden CPU spikes.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
// Basic demonstration of a music system that uses PlayScheduled to preload and sample-accurately
// stitch two AudioClips in an alternating fashion.  The code assumes that the music pieces are
// each 16 bars (4 beats / bar) at a tempo of 140 beats per minute.
// To make it stitch arbitrary clips just replace the line
//   nextEventTime += (60.0 / bpm) * numBeatsPerSegment
// by
//   nextEventTime += clips[flip].length;

The example at [AudioSource.SetScheduledEndTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioSource.SetScheduledEndTime.html) shows how you can play two audio clips without pops or clicks between the clips. The approach is to have two AudioSources with clips attached, and queue up each clip using its AudioSource.
