[UIElements.UIDocument](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.UIDocument.html) parentUI; 
### Description
If the GameObject that this UIDocument component is attached to has a parent GameObject, and that parent GameObject also has a UIDocument component attached to it, this value is set to the parent GameObject's UIDocument component automatically. 
If a UIDocument has a parent, you cannot add it directly to a panel. Unity adds it to the parent's root visual element instead.
