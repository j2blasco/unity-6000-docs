eyeTextureHeight; 
### Description
The current height of an eye texture for the loaded device.
This value will be the product of the default eye texture size for the HMD and [XRSettings.eyeTextureResolutionScale](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.XRSettings-eyeTextureResolutionScale.html). If XR isn't enabled this value will be zero.
