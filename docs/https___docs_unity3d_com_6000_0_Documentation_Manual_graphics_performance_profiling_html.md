# Graphics performance and profiling
This section contains information on understanding and improving rendering performance.
**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Reduce rendering work on the GPU or CPU](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/OptimizingGraphicsPerformance.html) | Reduce the amount of rendering on the CPU or the GPU, or reduce the rendering frame rate.  
[Optimizing draw calls](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/reduce-draw-calls-landing.html) | Techniques for speeding up rendering by reducing the number of drawing commands the CPU sends to the GPU.  
[Profile rendering](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/profile-rendering.html) | Resources for using the Frame Debugger window and the Frame Timing Manager to check and debug rendering issues.  
[Graphics performance and profiling in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/graphics-performance-and-profiling-in-urp.html) | Resources for understanding and improving rendering performance in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).  
[Graphics performance and profiling in the Built-In Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/graphics-performance-birp.html) | Resources for understanding and improving rendering performance in the Built-In Render Pipeline.
