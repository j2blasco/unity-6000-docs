### Description
Marks that the Control key modifier is part of the key combination. Resolves to control key on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
For most cases it is best to use [Action](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ShortcutManagement.ShortcutModifiers.Action.html) as it will represent the most appropriate action key for each particular platform.
