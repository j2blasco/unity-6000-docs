### Description
Generates detailed information in the [BuildReport](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Build.Reporting.BuildReport.html).
The BuildReport object returned by [BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer.html) will contain additional data about build times and contents. This might lead to slightly longer build time, typically by a few percents.  
  
The following script example illustrates how to use `DetailedBuildReport` when building a Player. Create a project and add the script under Assets/Editor.
```
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class DetailedBuildReportExample : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    [MenuItem[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MenuItem.html)("Build/DetailedBuildReport example")]
    public static void MyBuild()
    {
        BuildPlayerOptions[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPlayerOptions.html) buildPlayerOptions = new BuildPlayerOptions[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPlayerOptions.html)();
        buildPlayerOptions.scenes = new[] { "Assets/scene.unity" };
        buildPlayerOptions.locationPathName = "DetailedReportBuild/MyGame.exe";
        buildPlayerOptions.target = BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64.html);  
  
        buildPlayerOptions.options = BuildOptions.DetailedBuildReport[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildOptions.DetailedBuildReport.html);  
  
        var buildReport = BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer.html)(buildPlayerOptions);
    }
}

```

  2. Access the information about the build process in the `buildReport` variable which you can process using the [BuildReport](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Build.Reporting.BuildReport.html) API.
  3. Refer to the [Build Report Inspector source script ](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/BuildReportInspector) to find illustrations on how to query the [BuildReport](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Build.Reporting.BuildReport.html) API.
