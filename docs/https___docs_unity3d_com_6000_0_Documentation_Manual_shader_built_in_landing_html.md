# Prebuilt shaders
Resources for the prebuilt **shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) in Unity. Use prebuilt shaders to create a wide range of materials, from simple unlit colors to physically-based lit surfaces.

[Prebuilt shaders render pipeline compatibility reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-built-in.html) | Explore which prebuilt shaders are compatible with which **render pipelines** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).  
[Legacy prebuilt shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Built-inShaderGuide.html) | Resources for the over 80 legacy shaders that are included in Unity for backwards compatibility, but arenâ€™t recommended for new projects.
