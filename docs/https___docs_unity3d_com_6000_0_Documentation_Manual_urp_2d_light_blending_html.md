# Blend Modes in 2D lighting
Techniques and resources demonstrating how **Blend Styles** and masks affect how **sprites** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) are lit.
Topic | Description  
---|---  
[Blend modes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2d-light-blend-modes.html) | Understand how different **Blend Modes** visually affect the way a sprite is lit.  
[Masking](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2d-light-masking.html) | Understand how masks interact with different **Blend Modes**.  
[Add normal map and mask textures to a sprite in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/SecondaryTextures.html) | Assign **normal map** A type of Bump Map texture that allows you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Normalmap) and mask textures to sprites to create advanced lighting effects with 2D lights.  
[HDR emulation scale](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/HDREmulationScale.html) | Use High Dynamic Range (HDR) with 2D Lights if a platform doesnâ€™t natively support it.
