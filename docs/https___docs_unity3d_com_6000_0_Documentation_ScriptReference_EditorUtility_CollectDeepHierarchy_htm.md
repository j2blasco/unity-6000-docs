## Declaration
public static Object[] CollectDeepHierarchy(Object[] roots); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
roots | Array of objects where the search will start.  
### Returns
**Object[]** Array of objects heirarchically attached to the search array. 
### Description
Collect all objects in the hierarchy rooted at each of the given objects.
This is most useful for linearizing entire GameObject hierarchies including all their components.  
Note that the traversal will not include assets referenced from within the hierarchy. For example, having a MeshFilter component in the hierarchy will not cause the referenced Mesh to be included in the resulting list.

        // components (one belonging to "Parent" and one belonging to
        // "Child")
