# Debugging your tvOS application
To debug your application on a tvOS device, you need the following:
  * A fourth-generation Apple TV device.
  * Xcode 7.1 or later.
  * Set up [provisioning](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/devops/manual/build-automation/tutorials/building-for-ios#Provisioning_profiles) for this device in the same way as for iOS devices.


Connect the device to your machine using USB or a wireless connection. For more information on connecting your tvOS device wirelessly, refer to [Pair a wireless device with Xcode](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/11.4/index.html?localePath=en.lproj#/devbc48d1bad). To test that provisioning works correctly, create an empty tvOS app with Xcode.
