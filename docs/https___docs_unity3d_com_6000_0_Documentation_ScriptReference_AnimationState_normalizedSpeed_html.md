normalizedSpeed; 
### Description
The normalized playback speed.
This is most commonly used to synchronize playback speed when blending between two animations. In most cases it is easier and better to use [Animation Layer syncing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationLayers.html) instead.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Animation[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animation.html) anim;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        anim = GetComponent<Animation[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animation.html)>();
        anim["Run"].normalizedSpeed = anim["Walk"].normalizedSpeed;
    }
}

```
