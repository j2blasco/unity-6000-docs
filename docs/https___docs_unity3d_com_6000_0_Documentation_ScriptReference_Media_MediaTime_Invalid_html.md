[Media.MediaTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Media.MediaTime.html) Invalid; 
### Description
Invalid time value.
Invalid time values have an invalid rate (see [MediaRational.isValid](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Media.MediaRational-isValid.html)), regardless of the [count](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Media.MediaTime-count.html) value. This utility value just provides one of the many possible invalid [MediaTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Media.MediaTime.html)s.
