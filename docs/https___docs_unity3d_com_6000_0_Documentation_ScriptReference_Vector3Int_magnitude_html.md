magnitude; 
### Description
Returns the length of this vector (Read Only).
The length of the vector is square root of `(x*x+y*y+z*z)`.  
  
If you only need to compare magnitudes of some vectors, you can compare squared magnitudes of them using [sqrMagnitude](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3Int-sqrMagnitude.html) (computing squared magnitudes is faster).
