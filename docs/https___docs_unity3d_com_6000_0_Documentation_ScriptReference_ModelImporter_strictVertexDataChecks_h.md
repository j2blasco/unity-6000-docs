strictVertexDataChecks; 
### Description
Enables strict checks on imported vertex data.
When enabled, checks are performed on the imported vertex data. When invalid data is found, it is discarded and a warning message is logged in the console. This may result in missing vertex data but ensures that results are consistent and can prevent crashes during imports. Checks involve a performance penalty and are disabled by default.
