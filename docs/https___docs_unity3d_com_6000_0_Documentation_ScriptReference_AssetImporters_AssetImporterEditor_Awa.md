## Declaration
protected void Awake(); 
### Description
This function is called when the Editor script is started.
Awake is called as the AssetImporterEditor script starts. This happens as the editor is launched and is similar to [MonoBehaviour.Awake](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html).
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);
using UnityEditor.AssetImporters;  
  
public class ExampleScript : AssetImporterEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetImporters.AssetImporterEditor.html)
{
    protected override void Awake()
    {
        base.Awake();
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Awake");
    }
}

```
