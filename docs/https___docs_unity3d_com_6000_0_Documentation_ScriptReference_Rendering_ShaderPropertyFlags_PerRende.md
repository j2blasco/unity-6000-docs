### Description
In the Material Inspector, Unity queries the value for this property from the Renderer's [MaterialPropertyBlock](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MaterialPropertyBlock.html), instead of from the Material. The value will also appear as read-only.
This flag corresponds to the "[PerRendererData]" attribute.
