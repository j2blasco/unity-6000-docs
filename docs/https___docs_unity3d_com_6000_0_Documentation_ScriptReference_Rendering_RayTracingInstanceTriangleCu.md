frontTriangleCounterClockwise; 
### Description
This property reverses front and back facings triangles, which is useful if for example, the applicationâ€™s natural winding order differs from the default.
By default, a triangle is front facing if its vertices appear clockwise from the ray origin and back facing if its vertices appear counter-clockwise from the ray origin, in object space in a left-handed coordinate system.
