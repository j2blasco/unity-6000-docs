maxGraphicsBufferSize; 
### Description
The maximum size of a graphics buffer ([GraphicsBuffer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GraphicsBuffer.html), [ComputeBuffer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ComputeBuffer.html), vertex/index buffer, etc.) in bytes (Read Only).
This property has the same functionality as [SystemInfo.maxGraphicsBufferSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-maxGraphicsBufferSize.html), and also mimics platform-specific behavior in the Unity Editor.
