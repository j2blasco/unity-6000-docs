## Declaration
public void OnProcessScene([SceneManagement.Scene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.Scene.html) scene, [Build.Reporting.BuildReport](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Build.Reporting.BuildReport.html) report); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
scene | The current Scene being processed.  
report | A report containing information about the current build. When this callback is invoked for Scene loading during Editor playmode, this parameter will be null.  
### Description
Implement this function to receive a callback for each Scene during the build.
This callback is invoked during Player and AssetBundle builds, and also as a scene is reloaded while entering Editor playmode. [BuildPipeline.isBuildingPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPipeline-isBuildingPlayer.html) can be used to determine in which context the callback is being called.
