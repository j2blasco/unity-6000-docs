## Declaration
public void OnDeactivate(); 
### Description
Called when your version control system is deactivated.
This happens when the user selects a different VCS from Version Control settings window, or if it gets deactivated from script, or when the Editor is closed.  
  
Unity calls this method to inform [VersionControlObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/VersionControl.VersionControlObject.html) that it's no longer active and VCS operations such as checkout or submit should no longer be performed.
```
using UnityEditor.VersionControl;
using UnityEngine;  
  
[VersionControl("Custom")]
public class CustomVersionControlObject : VersionControlObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/VersionControl.VersionControlObject.html)
{
    public override void OnActivate()
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Custom VCS activated.");
    }  
  
    public override void OnDeactivate()
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Custom VCS deactivated.");
    }
}

```
