# Legacy Animation component
[Switch to Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animation.html "Go to Animation page in the Scripting Reference")
This is the Legacy Animation component, which was used on **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) for animation purposes prior to the introduction of the Mecanim Animation system. This component is retained in Unity for backwards compatibility. For new projects, use the [Animator component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Animator.html)A component on a model that animates that model using the Animation system. The component has a reference to an Animator Controller asset that controls the animation. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-AnimatorController.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AnimatorComponent).
