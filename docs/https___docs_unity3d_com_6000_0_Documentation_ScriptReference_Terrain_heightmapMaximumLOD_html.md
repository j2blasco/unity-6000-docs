heightmapMaximumLOD; 
### Description
Limits the Terrain's maximum rendering resolution.
Use on low-end graphics cards to block the highest level of detail for Terrain. A value of 0 for this property allows the terrain to be shown at the highest detail. A value of 1 reduces the maximum triangle count to one-fourth of its current value and halves the width and height of the heightmap resolution. 
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Terrain.activeTerrain.heightmapMaximumLOD = 1;
    }
}
