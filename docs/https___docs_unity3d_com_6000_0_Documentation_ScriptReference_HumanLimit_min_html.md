[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) min; 
### Description
The maximum negative rotation away from the initial value that this muscle can apply.
The [center](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HumanLimit-center.html) property specifies the rotation of the bone when the muscle is at "rest". The `min` value specfies the maximum negative rotation in degrees away from the rest value that the muscle can apply. The [max](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HumanLimit-max.html) value specifies a similar limit but in the positive direction of rotation.  
  
The allowed range for the minimum is -180..0 degrees.
