### Description
OnRenderObject is called after camera has rendered the Scene.
This can be used to render your own objects using [Graphics.DrawMeshNow](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.DrawMeshNow.html) or other functions. This function is similar to [OnPostRender](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.OnPostRender.html), except OnRenderObject is called on any object that has a script with the function; no matter if it's attached to a Camera or not.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    Mesh[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.html) mainMesh;
    Mesh[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.html) miniMapMesh;  
  
    void OnRenderObject()
    {
        // Render different meshes for the object depending on whether
        // the main camera or minimap camera is viewing.
        if (Camera.current.name == "MiniMapcam")
        {
            Graphics.DrawMeshNow[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.DrawMeshNow.html)(miniMapMesh, transform.position, transform.rotation);
        }
        else
        {
            Graphics.DrawMeshNow[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.DrawMeshNow.html)(mainMesh, transform.position, transform.rotation);
        }
    }
