See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite):
  1. Click on it in the ****Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) View** and then edit via the ****Sprite Renderer** A component that lets you display images as Sprites for use in both 2D and 3D scenes.
