[TextureMipmapLimitBiasMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureMipmapLimitBiasMode.html) limitBiasMode; 
### Description
Indicates whether the [limitBias](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureMipmapLimitSettings-limitBias.html) functions as an offset to the global texture mipmap limit or, instead, acts as an override to it.
By default, this is equal to [TextureMipmapLimitBiasMode.OffsetGlobalLimit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureMipmapLimitBiasMode.OffsetGlobalLimit.html). For additional information, see [limitBias](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureMipmapLimitSettings-limitBias.html).
