## Declaration
public void SetScheduledEndTime(double time); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
time | Time in seconds.  
### Description
Changes the time at which a sound that has already been scheduled to play will end. Notice that depending on the timing not all rescheduling requests can be fulfilled.
Note that the time specified is still a time on the absolute time-line, meaning that the sound will stop when reaching that time, regardless of when it was started. So if you have a 5 second long sound and want it to play at time T and stop after 3 seconds (i.e. silencing the last 2 seconds of the sound), you need to specify the end time to be T+3. This function is useful in music systems to overcome the discontinuities in signals that frame-based lossy codecs cause.
```

// While this may seem unnecessarily complicated to do this in the case of uncompressed sounds, you can now use
// the SavWav code from https://gist.github.com/2317063 to save the generated clips into new assets,
// run the program once with a specified sourceClip and the script will generate "cut1.wav" and "cut2.wav".
// These can now be imported into Unity as assets and changed to compressed sounds.
// Since psychoacoustic compression severely alters the waveforms and frequency content of sounds and
// furthermore operates in a block-based fashion, it would cause very noticeable pops and clicks if we didn't
// have the sound data after and before the cut point. By having it, even though we are not playing it, the decoder is "warmed up",
// i.e. it has matching frequency content before and after the transition, so at least the
// frequency spectrum will be more or less the same before and after the transition and so the click will be less audible
// than if we had just cut up the sound without the 0.2s overlap regions.
// This method may also be combined with cross-fading in order to further smoothen out any remaining artifacts.

**Note:** If possible create clips that overlap, and use the scheduled end time for the first, and [AudioSource.time](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioSource-time.html) for the second to trim out the overlapped part, as the example above shows.
