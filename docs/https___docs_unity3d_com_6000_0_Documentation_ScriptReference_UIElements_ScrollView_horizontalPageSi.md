horizontalPageSize; 
### Description
This property controls the speed of the horizontal scrolling when using a keyboard or the on-screen scrollbar buttons (arrows and handle), based on the size of the page. 
When scrolling the page size will be applied to the offset for each scroll step, so the final offset will be the page size multiplied by the number of steps. Additional resources: [BaseSlider_1.pageSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BaseSlider_1-pageSize.html).
