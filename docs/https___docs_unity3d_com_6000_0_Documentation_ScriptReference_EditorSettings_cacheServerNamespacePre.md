cacheServerNamespacePrefix; 
### Description
Sets the namespace prefix to use for the cache server.
Each entry on the cache server is stored using a namespace/key/value tuple. The namespace can be used for grouping cached results together. This will minimize the the risk of hashing clashes as well as provide more speed during lookup. This setting is project wide.
