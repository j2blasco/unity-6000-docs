### Description
Context is the object that is the target of a menu command.
Usually the context is the current selection or the item under the mouse when invoking a context menu. The new menu item is added to the list supplied by the selected component. The component in the Inspector has a clickable circular item at the top right. The image below shows how the Rigidbody has a MenuItem that is accessible with a click. The Context name is "Do Something". See the script below.
