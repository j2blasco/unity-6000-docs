public void Prepare(); 
### Description
Prepares the playback engine so that it's ready for playback.
To prepare, the playback engine reserves the resources vital for playback, and preloads some of the content to be played. If the preparation succeeds, this method emits the [VideoPlayer.prepareCompleted](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-prepareCompleted.html) event and sets [VideoPlayer.isPrepared](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-isPrepared.html) to `true`. The VideoPlayer is then ready to display the frames immediately and you can access all properties related to the source.   
  
If you don't prepare the VideoPlayer before you play a video, the [VideoPlayer.Play](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.Play.html) method will do the preparation but the video won't play instantly. If you use [VideoPlayer.Stop](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.Stop.html), the VideoPlayer becomes unprepared again because it frees its resources for performance reasons. To halt a video but keep its preparation, use [VideoPlayer.Pause](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.Pause.html) instead.
