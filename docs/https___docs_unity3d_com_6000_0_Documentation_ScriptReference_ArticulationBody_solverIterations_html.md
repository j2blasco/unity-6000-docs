solverIterations; 
### Description
The solverIterations determines how accurately articulation body joints and collision contacts are resolved.
If you are having trouble with connected articulation bodies oscillating and behaving erratically, setting a higher solver iteration count may improve their stability, but is slower to compute. Overrides [Physics.defaultSolverIterations](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics-defaultSolverIterations.html). Must be positive.
