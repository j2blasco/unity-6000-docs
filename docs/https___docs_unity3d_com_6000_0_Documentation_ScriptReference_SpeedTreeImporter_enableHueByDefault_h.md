enableHueByDefault; 
### Description
Gets and sets a boolean to enable hue variation effect on the imported SpeedTree model.
Hue variation varies the color of the model based on its world position, resulting in a more natural forest look. Use this variable to toggle this effect and see [SpeedTreeImporter.hueVariation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter-hueVariation.html) to set a variation color.  
  
To change this setting for a specific LOD, see [SpeedTreeImporter.enableHue](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter-enableHue.html) and [SpeedTreeImporter.enableSettingOverride](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter-enableSettingOverride.html).
