### Description
This can be useful to get notified when the SceneManager's scenes are replaced with a set of new scenes from calls to [RestoreSceneManagerSetup](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.RestoreSceneManagerSetup.html).  
  
Use the `scenes` argument to check what scenes has just been opened.
