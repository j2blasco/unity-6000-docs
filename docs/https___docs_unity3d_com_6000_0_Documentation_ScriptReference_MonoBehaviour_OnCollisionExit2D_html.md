### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
other | The Collision2D data associated with this collision.  
### Description
Sent when a collider on another object stops touching this object's collider (2D physics only).
Further information about the objects involved is reported in the Collision2D parameter passed during the call. If you don't need this information then you can declare OnCollisionExit2D without the parameter.  
  
**Note:** Collision events will be sent to disabled MonoBehaviours, to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions.
