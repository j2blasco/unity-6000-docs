### Description
The SpriteRenderer will render the sprite as a 9-slice image where the corners will remain constant and the other sections will scale.
When resizing a 9-sliced sprite the corners will remain unscaled while the other sections will be scaled. Note: For this method to work properly the Sprite assigned to [SpriteRenderer.sprite](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpriteRenderer-sprite.html) needs to have [Sprite.border](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Sprite-border.html) defined.
