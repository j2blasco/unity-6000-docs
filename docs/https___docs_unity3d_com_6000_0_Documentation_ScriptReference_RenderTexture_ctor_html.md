## Declaration
public RenderTexture(int width, int height, int depth, [RenderTextureFormat](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureFormat.html) format = RenderTextureFormat.Default, [RenderTextureReadWrite](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureReadWrite.html) readWrite = RenderTextureReadWrite.Default); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
width | Texture width in pixels.  
height | Texture height in pixels.  
depth | Number of bits in depth buffer (0, 16, 24 or 32). Note that only 24 and 32 bit depth have stencil buffer support.  
format | Texture color format.  
colorFormat | The color format for the RenderTexture.  
depthStencilFormat | The depth stencil format for the RenderTexture.  
mipCount | Amount of mips to allocate for the RenderTexture.  
readWrite | How color space conversions are applied on texture read/write.  
desc | Create the RenderTexture with the settings in the RenderTextureDescriptor.  
textureToCopy | Copy the settings from another RenderTexture.  
### Description
Creates a new RenderTexture object.
The render texture is created with `width` by `height` size, with a depth buffer of `depth` bits (depth can be 0, 16, 24 or 32), and in `format` format and with sRGB read / write on or off.  
  
Note that constructing a RenderTexture object does not create the hardware representation immediately. The actual render texture is created upon first use or when [Create](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.Create.html) is called manually. So after constructing the render texture, it is possible to set additional variables, like [format](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-graphicsFormat.html), [dimension](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-dimension.html) and so on.  
  
Also note that your graphics device capabilities determine the maximum size of a RenderTexture. To determine the maximum size, use [SystemInfo.maxTextureSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-maxTextureSize.html) for 2D and cubemap RenderTextures, [SystemInfo.maxTexture3DSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-maxTexture3DSize.html) for 3D RenderTextures, and [SystemInfo.maxTextureSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-maxTextureSize.html) and [SystemInfo.maxTextureArraySlices](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-maxTextureArraySlices.html) for 2D array RenderTextures.  
  
When the requested size exceeds the maximum size, Unity's behavior varies. If the RenderTexture is not a 3D texture, and the requested size is a power of two, Unity automatically scales down the requested size by a factor of 2 until it is below the maximum, and then creates the RenderTexture at that size. Otherwise, Unity fails to create the RenderTexture, and throws an error.
