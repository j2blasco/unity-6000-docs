# 2D Physics
Unity’s physics system lets you handle 2D physics to make use of optimizations available with 2D. You can use the following physics 2D components with Unity:
**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Rigidbody 2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/rigidbody/rigidbody-2d-landing.html) | Learn how **Rigidbody** A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Rigidbody) 2D works.  
[Collider 2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/collider/collider-2d-landing.html) | Understand the types of **Collider** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collider) 2D components available to use with Rigidbody 2D.  
[Effectors 2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/effectors/effectors-2d-landing.html) | Approaches and techniques to working with the forces of physics when **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) colliders are in contact.  
[2D Joints](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/2d-joints-landing.html) | Understand the types of 2D **Joints** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint) available to use with 2D GameObjects.  
[Physics 2D Profiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/physics-profiler/physics-2d-profiler-landing.html) | Approaches to analyzing the performance of 2D physics in your application.  
[Constant Force 2D reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/constant-force-2d-reference.html) | Explore the properties that control **constant forces** A simple component for adding a constant force or torque to game objects with a Rigidbody. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ConstantForce.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#ConstantForce) applied to a Rigidbody 2D.  
[Physics Material 2D reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/physics-material-2d-reference.html) | Explore the properties that control the friction and bounce between colliding 2D physics objects.
