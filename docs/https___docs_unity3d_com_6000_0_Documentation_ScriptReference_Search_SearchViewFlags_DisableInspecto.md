### Description
This flag disables the use of the Inspector Preview in the Search Picker window.
This flag is not set by default. When it is set, the Search Picker window will not show any panel or button related to the Inspector Preview. The flag [OpenInspectorPreview](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Search.SearchViewFlags.OpenInspectorPreview.html) will not work when [DisableInspectorPreview](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Search.SearchViewFlags.DisableInspectorPreview.html) is set.
