### Description
Extremely detailed messages are reported, in addition to anything from the [LogLevel.Debug](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PackageManager.LogLevel.Debug.html) level.
Most detailed level of information. Note that using this level may quickly result in a very large `upm.log` file.
