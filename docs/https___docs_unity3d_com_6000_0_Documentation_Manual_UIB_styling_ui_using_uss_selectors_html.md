# Style UI with UI Builder
In UI Builder, you can style an element with inline styles or USS selectors. Inline styles are typically used for single-use or experimental purposes, whereas managing styles through style sheets tends to be easier and more efficient. You can extract [inline styles to a USS class](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UIB-getting-started.html#extract-inline-styles). You can also manage style sheets and USS selectors in UI Builder. 
## Set inline styles to elements
You can set inline styles to elements in the **Inlined Styles** section in the element’s **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector) window.
Style fields that appear **bold** with a solid line on the left of the field label represent style properties that are already set or **overridden**. It’s important to keep track of these **overridden** style properties, as they always override the same property coming from a StyleSheet or from a C# default. To unset or remove the **override** for a style property, right-click on the style field and select **Unset**.
**Note** : You can’t use inline style to style [pseudo-classes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UIE-USS-Selectors-Pseudo-Classes.html) or [read-only elements](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UIB-structuring-ui-elements.html#read-only-elements).
## Manage a style sheet
To add a style sheet, use the **+** dropdown menu and select one of the following options:
  * **Create New USS** : This opens a **Save File Dialog** to create a new style sheet in your project.
  * **Add Existing USS** : This opens the **Open File Dialog** to add an existing style sheet to the UI Document.


To remove a style sheet from the active UI Document, right-click on the style sheet and select **Remove USS**.
To make a style sheet active, right-click on a style sheet and select **Set as Active USS**. An **Active StyleSheet** appears bold.
When you edit sub-documents, the style sheets that belong to parent documents appear dimmed and are read-only.
**Note** : You can add comments in a USS file with a text editor the same way as you do with a CSS file. However, if you open the USS file in the UI Builder, the comments are removed as soon as you save the USS file from the UI Builder.
## Create USS selectors
You can create any new USS selectors in the StyleSheets window. You can also create a new class selector in the **StyleSheets** section in the Inspector window. A new selector is always added to the **Active StyleSheet**.
To create a new selector in the StyleSheets window:
  1. In the StyleSheets window, click in the **Add new selector…** field. This opens a USS selector syntax reference window on top of the ****Viewport** The user’s visible area of an app on their screen.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Viewport)** as shown in the image below:
![USS Selector cheatsheet](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/UIBuilder/UIBuilderSelectorCheatsheet.png) USS Selector cheatsheet
  2. Enter the selector with the correct syntax. For example, a class selector should start with `.`.
  3. Press the Enter key.
  4. In the StyleSheets window, select the newly-created selector.
  5. In the selector’s Inspector window, set the desired styles for the selector.


To create a new class selector in an element’s Inspector window:
  1. In the Hierarchy window, select the element.
  2. In the Inspector window, enter the class selector in the **Style Class List** text field.
  3. Select **Add Style Class to List**. A yellow-style class label appears in **Style Class List**. 
![StyleSheet section of Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/UIBuilder/StyleSheetSectionOfInspector.png) StyleSheet section of Inspector
  4. If the yellow-style class label appears faded, it means the selector doesn’t exist in the attached StyleSheets. You can double-click on it to create a new class selector. If the class selector exists, you can double-click on it to open the selector’s Inspector window.


## Manipulate USS selectors
To copy, paste, duplicate, rename, or delete one or more USS selectors:
  1. In the StyleSheets window, select the group.
  2. Right-click the group and select the desired action.


**Tip** : You can copy and paste a USS selector between the UI Builder’s StyleSheets window and a text editor.
## Match USS style class to elements
You can match USS classes to elements. For example, if you have the following USS style:
![StyleSheetsPaneWithSelectors](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/UIBuilder/StyleSheetsPaneWithSelectors.png) StyleSheetsPaneWithSelectors
To match USS style class to elements, do any of the following:
  * Drag a style class label, like ![StyleClassLabel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/UIBuilder/StyleClassPill.png), onto the element in either the **Hierarchy** or the **Canvas**.
  * Enter the name of the selector into the **StyleSheet** > **Style Class List** field in the element’s Inspector window and then select **Add Style Class to List** :
