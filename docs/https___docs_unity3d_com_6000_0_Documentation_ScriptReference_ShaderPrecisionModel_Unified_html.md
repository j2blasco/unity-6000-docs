### Description
Use full sampler precision by default, and explicitly declare when you want to use lower precision. Refer to [SL-DataTypesAndPrecision](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SL-DataTypesAndPrecision.html) for more information. In addition, `half` is defined as `min16float` on all platforms. This sets [BuiltinShaderDefine.UNITY_UNIFIED_SHADER_PRECISION_MODEL](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.BuiltinShaderDefine.UNITY_UNIFIED_SHADER_PRECISION_MODEL.html) when Unity compiles shaders.
