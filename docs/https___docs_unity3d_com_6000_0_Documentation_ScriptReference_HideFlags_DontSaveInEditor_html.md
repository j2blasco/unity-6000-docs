### Description
The object will not be saved to the Scene in the editor.
For Prefab instances in a scene, you can set the hideflag on the Prefab instance handle object as a way to set the same hideflags on all the objects of the Prefab instance. (See [PrefabUtility.GetPrefabInstanceHandle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PrefabUtility.GetPrefabInstanceHandle.html)).
