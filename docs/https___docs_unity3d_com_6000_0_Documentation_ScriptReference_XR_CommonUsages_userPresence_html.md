userPresence; 
### Description
Use this property to test whether the user is currently wearing and/or interacting with the XR device. The exact behavior of this property varies with each type of device: some devices have a sensor specifically to detect user proximity, however you can reasonably infer that a user is present with the device when the property is UserPresenceState.Present.
