# Universal Additional Light Data component in URP
[Universal Additional Light Data](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.Rendering.Universal.UniversalAdditionalLightData.html) is a component that the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP) uses for internal data storage. The Universal Additional Light Data component allows URP to extend and override the functionality of Unity’s standard Light component.
In URP, a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) that has a Light component must also have a Universal Additional Light Data component. If your Project uses URP, Unity automatically adds the Universal Additional Light Data component when you create a Light GameObject. You cannot remove the Universal Additional Light Data component from a Light GameObject.
