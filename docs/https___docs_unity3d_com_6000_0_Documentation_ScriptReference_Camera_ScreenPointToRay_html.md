## Declaration
public [Ray](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Ray.html) ScreenPointToRay([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) pos, [Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.html) eye); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
pos | A 3D point, with the x and y coordinates containing a 2D screen space point in pixels. The lower left pixel of the screen is (0,0). The upper right pixel of the screen is (screen width in pixels - 1, screen height in pixels - 1). Unity ignores the z coordinate.  
eye | Optional argument that can be used to specify which eye transform to use. Default is Mono.  
### Description
Returns a ray going from camera through a screen point.
Resulting ray is in world space, starting on the near plane of the camera and going through position's (x,y) pixel coordinates on the screen.
