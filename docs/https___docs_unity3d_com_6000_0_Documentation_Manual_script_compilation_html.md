# Script compilation
This section contains information on how Unity compiles your **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts) and in what order.
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Special folders](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/script-compile-order-folders.html) | Information about the reserved folder names in Unity, which have an effect on the order of script compilation.  
[Conditional compilation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/conditional-compilation.html) | Use and define preprocessor directives to selectively include or exclude sections of your code for compilation.  
[Assembly definitions](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/assembly-definition-files.html) | Information about assembly definitions, which you can use to organize the scripts in your project.  
[Managed code stripping](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/managed-code-stripping.html) | Understand and configure managed code stripping, which removes unused code from a build and helps decrease the final build size of your application.

  * [Scripting backends](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scripting-backends.html)A framework that powers scripting in Unity. Unity supports three different scripting backends depending on target platform: Mono, .NET and IL2CPP. Universal Windows Platform, however, supports only two: .NET and IL2CPP.
