### Description
Sets the defaultDockIndex to define where in a [DockZone](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Overlays.DockZone.html) an [Overlay](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Overlays.Overlay.html) is placed.
Dock zones are presented in ascending order. E.g., an index of 1 in a DockPosition.Left aligned container is presented to the left of an [Overlay](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Overlays.Overlay.html) with an index of 2.
