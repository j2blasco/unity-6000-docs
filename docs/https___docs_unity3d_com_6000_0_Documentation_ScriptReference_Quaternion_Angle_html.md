## Declaration
public static float Angle([Quaternion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) a, [Quaternion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) b); 
### Description
Returns the angle in degrees between two rotations `a` and `b`. The resulting angle ranges from 0 to 180.
Example: Think of two GameObjects (A and B) moving around a third GameObject (C). Lines from C to A and C to B create a triangle which can change over time. The angle between CA and CB is the value [Quaternion.Angle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.Angle.html) provides.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
// Calculates the angle (degrees) between
// the rotation of this transform and target.  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Transform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) target;  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        float angle = Quaternion.Angle[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.Angle.html)(transform.rotation, target.rotation);
    }
}

```
