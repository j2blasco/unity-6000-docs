# Decals and projectors
Resources and techniques for projecting materials to act as decals that decorate the surface of other materials. 
**Topic** | **Description**

[Introduction to decals and projection](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/introduction-decals-projection.html) | Understand what decals are, how Unity uses projection to create them, and what you could use projection for.  
[Decals in the Universal Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/renderer-feature-decal-landing.html) | Techniques for using a Decal Renderer Feature or a Decal Projector in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)

## Render pipeline information
How you work with decals and projectors depends on the render pipeline you use.
