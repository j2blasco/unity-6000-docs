# Activity requirements and compatibility
Activity was originally the only application entry point that Unity supported and because of this itâ€™s very stable in the majority of scenarios and is compatible with the majority of Unity features.
## Plug-in compatibility
If you use Activity, your application player loop runs on a Java thread. This means that you can call Java APIs like [myLooper](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Looper#myLooper\(\)) from **plug-ins** A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Plug-in).
## Choreographer
If you use Activity, Unity uses the [Java choreographer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Choreographer). This helps you to understand how frame synchronization occurs in your application.
