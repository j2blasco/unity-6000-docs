### Description
AssetBundle building map entry.
This structure is used with [BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles.html) to specify the name of a bundle and the names of the assets that it will contain. The array of AssetBundleBuild elements that is passed to the function is known as the "building map" and serves as an alternative to specifying the contents of bundles from the editor.
