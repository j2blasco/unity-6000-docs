# Visual Effect Graph
The Visual Effect Graph is a package that you can use to create large-scale visual effects for your Unity Project. The Visual Effect Graph simulates particle behavior on the GPU, which allows it to simulate many more particles than the Built-in **Particle System** A component that simulates fluid entities such as liquids, clouds and flames by generating and animating large numbers of small 2D images in the scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ParticleSystem.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#particlesystem). If you want to create visual effects that include a large number of particles and need highly customisable behavior, use the Visual Effect Graph instead of the Built-in Particle System. For information on how to install and use the Visual Effect Graph, see the [getting started guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualeffectgraph@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/GettingStarted.html).
