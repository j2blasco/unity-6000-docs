# Import local asset packages
You can import locally saved asset packages (`.unitypackage` files) into the Unity Editor for use in your project.
**Note** : For information about using the Package Manager window to import an asset package you purchased or downloaded from the **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AssetStore), refer to [Download and import an asset package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-import.html).
To import a local asset package:
  1. Open the project you want to import the asset package into.
  2. Go to **Assets** > **Import Package** > **Custom Package**. A file browser appears, prompting you to locate the `.unitypackage` file.
  3. In the file browser, select the file you want to import and click **Open**.
The **Import Unity Package** window displays all the items in the package already selected, ready to install.
  4. Deselect any items you donâ€™t want to import and click **Import**. Unity puts the contents of the imported asset package into the `Assets` folder, so that you can access them from your **Project window** A window that shows the contents of your `Assets` folder (Project tab) [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ProjectView.html)
