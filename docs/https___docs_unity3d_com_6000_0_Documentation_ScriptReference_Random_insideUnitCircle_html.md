[Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) insideUnitCircle; 
### Description
Returns a random point inside or on a circle with radius 1.0 (Read Only).
Note that the probability space includes the perimeter of the circle because [value](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random-value.html), which is inclusive to 1.0, is used to acquire a random radius.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class ScriptExample : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Sets the position to be somewhere inside a circle
        // with radius 5 and the center at zero. Note that
        // assigning a Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) to a Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) is fine - it will
        // just set the X and Y values.
        transform.position = Random.insideUnitCircle[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random-insideUnitCircle.html) * 5;
    }
}
