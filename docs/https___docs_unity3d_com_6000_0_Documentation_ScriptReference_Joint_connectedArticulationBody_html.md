### Description
A reference to an articulation body this joint connects to.
A joint can connect to only one of [Joint.connectedBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint-connectedBody.html) and [Joint.connectedArticulationBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint-connectedArticulationBody.html). If both are set, [Joint.connectedBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint-connectedBody.html) takes precedence.
