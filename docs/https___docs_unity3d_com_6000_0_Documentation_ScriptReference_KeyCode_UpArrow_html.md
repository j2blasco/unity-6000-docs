### Description
Up arrow key.
Use this as a parameter to a function like [Input.GetKey](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetKey.html) to detect when the user presses the up arrow key. Additional resources: [Input.GetKey](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetKey.html), [Input.GetKeyDown](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetKeyDown.html), [Input.GetKeyUp](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetKeyUp.html).
```
//Attach this to a GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html)
//This script tells when the up arrow key is pressed down and when it is released
