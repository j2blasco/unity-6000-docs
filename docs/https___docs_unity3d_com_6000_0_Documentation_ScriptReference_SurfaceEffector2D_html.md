### Description
Applies tangent forces along the surfaces of colliders.
When the source [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) is a trigger, the effector will apply forces whenever the target [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) overlaps the source. When the source [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) isn't a trigger, the effector will apply forces whenever the target [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) is in contact with the source only.  
  
This effector can be used to create constant speed elevators and moving surfaces.
