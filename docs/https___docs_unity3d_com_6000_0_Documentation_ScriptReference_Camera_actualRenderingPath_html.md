[RenderingPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderingPath.html) actualRenderingPath; 
### Description
The rendering path that is currently being used (Read Only).
The actual rendering path might be different from the user-specified [renderingPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-renderingPath.html) if the underlying GPU/platform does not support the requested one, or some other situation causes a fallback (for example, if deferred rendering is not supported with orthographic projection cameras).
