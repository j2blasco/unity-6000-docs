### Description
Use this property to control whether sorting is enabled for all the columns.
This property controls whether sorting is enabled for all columns and is set to true by default. If false, left-clicking any column header will have no effect.  
  
Use the [MultiColumnHeaderState.Column.canSort](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/IMGUI.Controls.MultiColumnHeaderState.Column-canSort.html) property to disable sorting of individual columns.
