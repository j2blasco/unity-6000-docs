lightmapResolution; 
### Description
Defines the number of texels to use per world unit when generating lightmaps.
The minimum value is 0.0001. The default value is 40. Increasing this value can improve the quality of baked lighting, but also increases the time it takes to generate. The default value is 2. Increasing this value can improve lightmap quality, but also increases bake times. Doubling this value causes the number of texels to quadruple, because the value refers to both the height and width of the lightmap. See the Occupied texels count in the statistics area at the bottom of the Lighting window.  
  
This setting affects lightmaps generated by the Baked Global Illumination system.  
  
When Unity serializes this `LightingSettings` object as a [Lighting Settings Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-LightingSettings.html), this property corresponds to the **Lightmap Resolution** property in the Lighting Settings Asset Inspector.
