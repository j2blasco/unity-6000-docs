### Description
An IEnumerable of types that contains the type constraints for this search.
If this IEnumerable contains null values, you can find the required type for the search in the SearchService.ObjectSelector.SearchContext.requiredTypeNames IEnumerable instead. Both IEnumerables contain the same number of elements, and map to each other one-to-one.
