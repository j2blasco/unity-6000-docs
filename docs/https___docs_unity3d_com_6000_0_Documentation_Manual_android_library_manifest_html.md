# Unity Library Manifest
A Unity Library Manifest is the main Unity manifest and contains information about the Unity Player and its [activity](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities). Unity uses a default Unity Library Manifest during the build process to generate the final [Android App Manifest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/android-manifest.html) for the application. For more information on how to modify this file, refer to [Modify Gradle project files](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/android-modify-gradle-project-files.html).
