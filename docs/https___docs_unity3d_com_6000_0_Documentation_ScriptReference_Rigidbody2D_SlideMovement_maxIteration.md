maxIterations; 
### Description
Controls the maximum number of iterations to perform when determining how a [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) will slide.
When a [Rigidbody2D.Slide](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.Slide.html) occurs, each contact that is detected is counted as an interation. An attempt will be made to change direction in a new iteration only if the number of iterations hasn't yet reached the maximum number of iterations allowed.
