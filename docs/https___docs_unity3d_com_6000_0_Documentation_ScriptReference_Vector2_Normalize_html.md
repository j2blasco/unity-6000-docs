## Declaration
public void Normalize(); 
### Description
Makes this vector have a [magnitude](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-magnitude.html) of 1.
When normalized, a vector keeps the same direction but its length is 1.0.  
  
Note that this function will change the current vector. If you want to keep the current vector unchanged, use [normalized](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2-normalized.html) variable.  
  
If this vector is too small to be normalized it will be set to zero.
