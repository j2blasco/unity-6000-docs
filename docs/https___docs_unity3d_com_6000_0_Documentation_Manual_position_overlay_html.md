# Position an overlay
Move overlays in the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) view to organize your workspace.
Overlays can float or dock to the edges or corners of the **Scene view** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SceneView).
If you want to save your overlay configuration, refer to [Create and manage overlay configurations](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/manage-overlay-configurations.html).
## Move overlays
Put overlays anywhere in the Scene view.
To move an overlay in the Scene view:
  1. Click and hold the handle (**=**) of the overlay you want to move.
  2. Drag the overlay to move it.


**Note:** Overlays that float in the Scene view can overlap each other. Select an overlay to bring it to the front.
## Dock overlays
Overlays can dock to the top, bottom, sides, and corners of the Scene view.
You can dock more than one overlay to the same edge or corner of the Scene view. However, multiple overlays docked to the same edge or corner are not connected with each other. If you move a docked overlay, other overlays docked to the same location do not move.
Expanded overlays that dock to the top or bottom of the Scene view display in the [horizontal layout](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/manage-overlay-layouts.html). Expanded overlays that dock to sides of the Scene view display in the [vertical layout](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/manage-overlay-layouts.html).
Overlays that aren’t **toolbars** A row of buttons and basic controls at the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in various ways (e.g. scaling, translation). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Toolbar.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Toolbar) [collapse](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/manage-overlay-layouts.html#expand-an-overlay) when they dock to an edge of the Scene view. For example, the [Orientation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html#gizmo) overlay collapses when it docks. Click the down arrow to access a collapsed overlay’s options.
To dock an overlay in the Scene view:
  1. Click and hold the handle (**=**) of the overlay you want to dock.
  2. Drag the overlay to a corner or edge of the Scene view. If the overlay can dock, the corner or edge highlights in blue.
  3. Release the overlay.
