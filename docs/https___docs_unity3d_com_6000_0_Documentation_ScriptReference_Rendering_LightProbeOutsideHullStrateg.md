### Description
Defines the way Unity chooses a probe to light a Renderer that is lit by Light Probes but positioned outside the bounds of the Light Probe tetrahedral hull.
Enable this option to require Unity to search for the probe closest to a Renderer lit with Light Probes but positioned outside a Light Probe tetrahedral hull. This is the more resource-intensive of the two options available.
