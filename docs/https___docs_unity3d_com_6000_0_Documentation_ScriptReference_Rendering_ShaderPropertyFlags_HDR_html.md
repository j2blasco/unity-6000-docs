### Description
Signifies that values of this property contain High Dynamic Range (HDR) data.
When this flag is set, the default Material Inspector displays a warning if you assign incompatible data in the Material. For example, if a Texture contains an alpha channel, which HDR Textures do not support, the default Material Inspector displays a warning and suggests that you fix it.  
  
This flag corresponds to the "[HDR]" attribute.
