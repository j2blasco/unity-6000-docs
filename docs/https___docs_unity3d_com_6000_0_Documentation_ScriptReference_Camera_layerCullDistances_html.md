layerCullDistances; 
### Description
Per-layer culling distances.
Normally Camera skips rendering of objects that are further away than [farClipPlane](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-farClipPlane.html). You can set up some [Layers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Layers.html) to use smaller culling distances using layerCullDistances. This is very useful to cull small objects early on, if you put them into appropriate layers.  
  
When assigning layerCullDistances, you need to assign float array that has 32 values. Zero values in cull distances means "use far plane distance".  
  
By default, per-layer culling will use a plane aligned with the camera. You can change this to a sphere by setting layerCullSpherical on the Camera to true.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Camera[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) camera = GetComponent<Camera[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html)>();
        float[] distances = new float[32];
        distances[10] = 15;
        camera.layerCullDistances = distances;
    }
}

```
