value; 
### Description
Returns a random float within [0.0..1.0] (range is inclusive) (Read Only).
**Important** : Both the lower and upper bounds are **inclusive**. Any given float value between 0.0 and 1.0, _including both 0.0 and 1.0_ , will appear on average approximately once every ten million random samples.  
  
See [Random](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random.html) for more examples of how `UnityEngine.Random` may be different from other random number generators.
