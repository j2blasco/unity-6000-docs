menuName; 
### Description
The display name for this type shown in the Assets/Create menu.
As with other menu item code, use a forward-slash ("/") path separator to group items into submenus. For example, specifying a MenuName of "Gameplay/Objective" will cause the menu item for a type to be 'Objective' inside a 'Gameplay' submenu of the Create submenu.  
  
**Note** : Trailing space characters are removed from the menu name string. This means menu items whose names differ only by trailing space characters will be created as the same menu item.
