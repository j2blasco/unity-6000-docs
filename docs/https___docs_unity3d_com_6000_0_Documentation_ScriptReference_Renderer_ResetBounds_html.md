public void ResetBounds(); 
### Description
Reset custom world space bounds.
After you have set up custom world space bounding volume override with [bounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer-bounds.html), you can remove it with `ResetBounds`. This makes the renderer use default world space bounding volume.
