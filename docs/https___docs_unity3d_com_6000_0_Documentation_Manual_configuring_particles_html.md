Particle emissions and emitters
# Configuring particles
Techniques and resources for configuring how Particle Systems emit particles, and the properties of individual particles from a **Particle System** A component that simulates fluid entities such as liquids, clouds and flames by generating and animating large numbers of small 2D images in the scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ParticleSystem.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#particlesystem).
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Particle emissions and emitters](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/particle-emissions-emitters.html) | Understand particle emissions, and how Unity manages them via Particle System modules.  
[Configuring global particle properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/configuring-global-particle-properties.html) | Understand the Particle System properties that configure all particles, including the initial state of new particles.  
[Particle movement](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/particle-movement.html) | Resources for configuring particle movement.  
[Particle appearance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/particle-appearance.html) | Resources for configuring particle appearance and particle rendering.  
[Particle physics](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/particle-physics.html) | Resources for configuring simulated physics and **collisions** A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion.
