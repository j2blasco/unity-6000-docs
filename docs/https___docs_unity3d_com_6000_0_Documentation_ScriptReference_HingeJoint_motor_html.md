[JointMotor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointMotor.html) motor; 
### Description
The motor will apply a force up to a maximum force to achieve the target velocity in degrees per second.
The motor tries to reach [JointMotor.targetVelocity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointMotor-targetVelocity.html) angular velocity in degrees per second. The motor will only be able to reach `targetVelocity`, if [JointMotor.force](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointMotor-force.html) is sufficiently large. If the joint is spinning faster than `targetVelocity` the motor will brake. A negative `targetVelocity` will make the motor spin in the opposite direction.  
  
The `force` is the maximum torque the motor can exert. If it is zero the motor is disabled.  
  
The motor will brake when it is spinning faster than `targetVelocity` only, if [JointMotor.freeSpin](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/JointMotor-freeSpin.html) is false. If `freeSpin` is true the motor will not brake.

    void Start()
    {
        var hinge = GetComponent<HingeJoint[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint.html)>();  
  
        // Make the hinge motor rotate with 90 degrees per second and a strong force.
        var motor = hinge.motor;
        motor.force = 100;
        motor.targetVelocity = 90;
        motor.freeSpin = false;
        hinge.motor = motor;
        hinge.useMotor = true;
    }

Modifying the motor does **not** automatically enable the motor.  
  
Enabling the motor **overrides** the [spring](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HingeJoint-spring.html), given the spring was enabled. If the motor is again disabled the spring will be restored.
