### Description
Unity sets UNITY_UNIFIED_SHADER_PRECISION_MODEL if, in Player Settings, you set **Shader Precision Model** to Unified.
If set, the default sampler precision is full precision on all platforms. In addition, shader type `half` is defined as `min16float`. See [ShaderPrecisionModel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ShaderPrecisionModel.html).
