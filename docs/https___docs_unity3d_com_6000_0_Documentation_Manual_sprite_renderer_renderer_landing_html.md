# Sprite Renderer
The ****Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) Renderer** component renders the **Sprite** and controls how it visually appears in a **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) for both [2D and 3D projects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2Dor3D.html).
When you create a sprite (**GameObject > 2D Object > Sprite**), Unity automatically creates a GameObject with the **Sprite Renderer** component attached. You can also add the component to an existing GameObject via the **Components** menu (**Component > Rendering > Sprite Renderer**).

[**Install the 2D Sprite package**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/renderer/install-2d-sprite-package.html) | Install the 2D Sprite package via the **Sprite Renderer** A component that lets you display images as Sprites for use in both 2D and 3D scenes. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/renderer/renderer-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SpriteRenderer) **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector).  
[**Add a Sprite Renderer to an existing GameObject**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/renderer/add-sprite-renderer-existing-gameobject.html) | Add a Sprite Renderer to an existing **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) to control the appearance of the sprite.  
[**Change the color of a sprite**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/renderer/change-color-sprite.html) | Adjust the sprite’s RGB and Alpha values.  
[**Set the sort point of a sprite**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/renderer/set-sort-point-sprite.html) | Use the Pivot option to set the render order based on distance from the **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) in Orthographic mode.  
[**Sprite Renderer reference**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/renderer/sprite-renderer-reference.html) | Set the sprite’s texture, color, material, draw mode, sort point, mask interaction, rendering order, and behavior during resizing and interaction with lighting and masks.
