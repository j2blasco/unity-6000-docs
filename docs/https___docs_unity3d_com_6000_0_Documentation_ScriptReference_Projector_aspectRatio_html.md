aspectRatio; 
### Description
The aspect ratio of the projection.
This is projection width divided by height. An aspect ratio of 1.0 makes the projection square; a ratio of 2.0 makes it twice as wide than high. Additional resources: [projector component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Projector.html).
