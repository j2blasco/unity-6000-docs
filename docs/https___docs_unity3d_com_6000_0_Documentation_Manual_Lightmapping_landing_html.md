# Precalculating surface lighting with lightmaps
Resources for improving performance by setting up Unity to do complicated lighting calculations ahead of time, either by baking **lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that contains the effects of light sources on static objects in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the effect of lighting. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Lightmap) into a build or creating lightmaps at runtime.

[Global illumination](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/choose-a-lighting-setup.html)A group of techniques that model both direct and indirect lighting to provide realistic lighting results.  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#globalillumination) | Learn about baking lightmaps before runtime, or creating lightmaps at runtime using **Enlighten** A lighting system by Geomerics used in Unity for Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Enlighten) Realtime Global Illumination.  
[Baking lightmaps before runtime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Lightmapping-baking-before-runtime.html) | Resources for precalculating the lit colors of **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) and storing them in textures called lightmaps.  
[Creating lightmaps at runtime with Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/realtime-gi-using-enlighten-landing.html) | Resources for using Enlighten to precalculate visibility information, which Unity uses to create and update lightmaps at runtime.  
[Configuring lightmapping](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/configure-lightmapping-settings.html) | Resources for choosing between baked and real-time lightmapping, and changing how GameObjects contribute to lightmaps.
