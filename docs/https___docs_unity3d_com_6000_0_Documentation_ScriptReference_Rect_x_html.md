x; 
### Description
The X coordinate of the rectangle.
This value is the same as [xMin](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect-xMin.html), but setting it will move the rectangle rather than resize it.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class RectExample : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Use this for initialization
    void Start()
    {
        Rect[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html) rect = new Rect[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html)(10, 10, 50, 30);
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("x = " + rect.x); // -- prints: x = 10
        rect.x = 20;
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)(rect); // prints: (x:20, y:10, width:50, height:30)
    }
}
