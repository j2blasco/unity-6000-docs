### Description
Adds a delegate to get notifications when the default specular Cubemap is changed.
This event is now obsolete. You should instead use the defaultReflectionTexture event. Note that mixing this callback and the new defaultReflectionTexture event might cause the event event to be fired multiple times (with the same argument).
