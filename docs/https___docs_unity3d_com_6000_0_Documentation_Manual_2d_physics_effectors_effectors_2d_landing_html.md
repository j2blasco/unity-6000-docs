# Effectors 2D
Use Effector 2D [components](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingComponents.html)A functional part of a GameObject. A GameObject can contain any number of components. Unity has many built-in components, and you can create your own by writing scripts that inherit from MonoBehaviour. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingComponents.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#component) with [Collider 2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/collider/collider-2d-landing.html) components to direct the forces of [physics](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PhysicsSection.html) when [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GameObjects.html)The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) **colliders** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collider) come into contact with each other. You can use the following Effectors 2D components in Unity:
