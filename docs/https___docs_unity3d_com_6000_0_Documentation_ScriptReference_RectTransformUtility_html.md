Utility class containing helper methods for working with [RectTransform](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransform.html).
### Static Methods
Method | Description  
---|---  
[CalculateRelativeRectTransformBounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransformUtility.CalculateRelativeRectTransformBounds.html) | Creates a Bounds object that encapsulates all the child RectTransform objects found in the child parameter, and converts the resulting bounds into local space relative to the root transform.  
[FlipLayoutAxes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransformUtility.FlipLayoutAxes.html) | Flips the horizontal and vertical axes of the RectTransform size and alignment, and optionally its children as well.  
[FlipLayoutOnAxis](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransformUtility.FlipLayoutOnAxis.html) | Flips the alignment of the RectTransform along the horizontal or vertical axis, and optionally its children as well.  
[PixelAdjustPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransformUtility.PixelAdjustPoint.html) | Convert a given point in screen space into a pixel correct point.  
[PixelAdjustRect](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransformUtility.PixelAdjustRect.html) | Given a rect transform, return the corner points in pixel accurate coordinates.  
[RectangleContainsScreenPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransformUtility.RectangleContainsScreenPoint.html) | Does the RectTransform contain the screen point?  
[ScreenPointToLocalPointInRectangle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransformUtility.ScreenPointToLocalPointInRectangle.html) | Transform a screen space point to a position in the local space of a RectTransform that is on the plane of its rectangle.  
[ScreenPointToRay](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransformUtility.ScreenPointToRay.html) | Transforms a screen space position into a ray.  
[ScreenPointToWorldPointInRectangle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransformUtility.ScreenPointToWorldPointInRectangle.html) | Transform a screen space point to a position in world space that is on the plane of the given RectTransform.  
[WorldToScreenPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransformUtility.WorldToScreenPoint.html) | Transforms a position in world space into a screen space point.
