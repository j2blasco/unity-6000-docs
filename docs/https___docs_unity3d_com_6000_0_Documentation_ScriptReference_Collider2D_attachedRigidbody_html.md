[Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) attachedRigidbody; 
### Description
The [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) attached to the [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html).
[Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) are automatically attached to a [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) on the same [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) as the [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) or if none is present then on a [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) on the nearest parent [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html). The property will be null if no [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) is attached. In this case, the [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) is attached to a hidden body known as the ground body that lives at the world origin as is set to be [RigidbodyType2D.Static](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyType2D.Static.html). No reference to this hidden body is available however.
