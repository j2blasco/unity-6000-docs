activeMipmapLimit; 
### Description
The number of high resolution mipmap levels from the texture that Unity doesn't upload to the GPU. (Read Only)
Unity takes a texture's mipmap limit settings into account to determine its active mipmap limit that affects how many texture mipmap levels are uploaded to the GPU. This property provides the active number of texture mipmap levels that Unity didn't upload to the GPU. This number is relative to the number of texture mipmap levels included in the build.  
  
Unity ensures that a certain platform-dependent number of mipmap levels are always uploaded regardless of the texture's mipmap limit. `activeMipmapLimit` can therefore be smaller than expected in certain cases.  
  
The following code example demonstrates how you can use `activeMipmapLimit` to perform a [Graphics.CopyTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.CopyTexture.html) operation on the GPU to copy the highest resolution mipmap level of a texture that uses mipmap limits to a new texture that does not use mipmap limits.
