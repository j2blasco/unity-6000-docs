### Description
Run UnityLinker in a less conservative mode than Low. This will further reduce code size beyond what Low can achieve. However, this additional reduction may come with tradeoffs. Possible side effects may include, having to maintain a custom link.xml file, and some reflection code paths may not behave the same.
