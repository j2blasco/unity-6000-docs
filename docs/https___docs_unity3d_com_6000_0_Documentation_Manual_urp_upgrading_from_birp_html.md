# Upgrading from the Built-In Render Pipeline to URP
Resources for using the **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) Converter to upgrade a project to URP, and match quality settings from the Built-In Render Pipeline. 
**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Convert assets using the Render Pipeline Converter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/features/rp-converter.html) | Converts assets made for a Built-in Render Pipeline project to assets compatible with URP.  
[Convert quality settings from the Built-In Render Pipeline to URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/birp-onboarding/quality-presets.html) | Match the performance of the **Low** and **High** default quality presets from the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Upgrading shaders from the Built-In Render Pipeline to URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/upgrade-shaders-landing.html) | Approaches for converting **shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) from a Built-In Render Pipeline project so that they work in a URP project.  
[Change how lights fade using light falloff in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/birp-onboarding/birp-light-falloff-in-urp.html) | Change the light falloff function in URP to quadratic falloff which has a very similar look to the Built-In Render Pipeline function.  
[Find Built-In Render Pipeline quality settings in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/birp-onboarding/quality-settings-location.html) | Find settings from the **Quality** window of the Built-In Render Pipeline, either in the ****Project Settings** A broad collection of settings which allow you to configure how Physics, Audio, Networking, Graphics, Input and many other areas of your project behave. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/comp-ManagerGroup.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#ProjectSettings)** window or the URP Asset in URP.
