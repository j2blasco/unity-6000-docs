### Description
A change of this type indicates that a property of an asset object in memory has changed. This happens for example when [Undo.RecordObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.RecordObject.html) is used with an instance of an asset (e.g. [Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.html)). Note that this only covers changes to asset objects in memory and not changes to assets in the project on disk.
