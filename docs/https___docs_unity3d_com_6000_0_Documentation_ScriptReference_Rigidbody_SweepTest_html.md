## Declaration
public bool SweepTest([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) direction, out [RaycastHit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RaycastHit.html) hitInfo, float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, [QueryTriggerInteraction](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QueryTriggerInteraction.html) queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
direction | The direction into which to sweep the rigidbody.  
hitInfo | If true is returned, `hitInfo` will contain more information about where the collider was hit (Additional resources: [RaycastHit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RaycastHit.html)).  
maxDistance | The length of the sweep.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
### Returns
**bool** True when the rigidbody sweep intersects any collider, otherwise false. 
### Description
Tests if a rigidbody would collide with anything, if it was moved through the Scene.
Tests if a rigidbody would collide with anything, if it was moved through the Scene. This is similar to doing a [Physics.Raycast](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html) for all points contained in any of a Rigidbody's colliders and returning the closest of all hits (if any) reported. This is useful for AI code, say if you need to know that an object would fit through a gap without colliding with anything.  
  
Note that this function only works when a primitive collider type (sphere, cube or capsule) or a convex mesh is attached to the rigidbody object - concave mesh colliders will not work, although they can be detected in the Scene by the sweep.
