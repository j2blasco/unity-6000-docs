componentOrder; 
### Description
The order of the component in the component menu (lower values appear higher in the menu).
**Note** : The order only affects the component item itself and doesn't influence any submenus.  
  
Scripts are first sorted by their namespace. Scripts without a namespace are positioned after those with a namespace.  
  
By default, menu items are assigned a position value of 20. The final placement of the item is determined by adding the `componentOrder` value to this default position. The order can be either positive or negative value.  
  
If your item has a priority of 11 or higher than the previous item, a separator is automatically added before your item in the menu.  
  
The following example uses a `componentOrder` of `-1` to bring **MyScript2** above **MyScript1** :
```
using UnityEngine;  
  

[AddComponentMenu[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AddComponentMenu.html)("My Scripts/My Script 1")]
public class MyScript1 : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
}  
  
[AddComponentMenu[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AddComponentMenu.html)("My Scripts/My Script 2", -1)]
public class MyScript2 : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
}

```
