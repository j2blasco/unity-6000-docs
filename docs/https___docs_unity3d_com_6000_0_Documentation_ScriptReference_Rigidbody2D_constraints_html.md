[RigidbodyConstraints2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyConstraints2D.html) constraints; 
### Description
Controls which degrees of freedom are allowed for the simulation of this [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html).
By default this is set to [RigidbodyConstraints2D.None](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RigidbodyConstraints2D.None.html), allowing rotation and movement along all axes.  
  
In some cases, you may want to constrain a [Rigidbody2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) to only move or rotate along some axes. You can use the bitwise OR operator to combine multiple constraints.
