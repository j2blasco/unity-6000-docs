# Get started with URP
Resources for understanding fundamental concepts and assets in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), and installing and upgrading.
**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[URP fundamentals](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/urp-concepts.html) | Resources for understanding the rendering loop and the different **rendering paths** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#RenderingPath) in URP.  
[Installing and upgrading URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/InstallingAndConfiguringURP.html) | Create a project that uses URP, or upgrade to URP from the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Configure for better performance](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/configure-for-better-performance.html) | Disable or change URP settings and features that have a large performance impact.

  * [Render pipelines](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)
