## Declaration
public static [AssetBundle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetBundle.html) LoadFromFile(string path); 
## Declaration
public static [AssetBundle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetBundle.html) LoadFromFile(string path, uint crc); 
## Declaration
public static [AssetBundle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetBundle.html) LoadFromFile(string path, uint crc, ulong offset); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
path | Path of the file on disk.  
crc | An optional CRC-32 checksum of the uncompressed content. If this is non-zero, then the content will be compared against the checksum before loading it, and give an error if it does not match.  
offset | An optional byte offset. This value specifies where to start reading the AssetBundle from.  
### Returns
**AssetBundle** Loaded AssetBundle object or null if failed. 
### Description
Synchronously loads an AssetBundle from a file on disk.
The function supports bundles of any compression type. In case of **LZMA** compression, the file content will be fully decompressed into memory and loaded from there. See [AssetBundles compression](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetBundles-Cache.html) for more details.  
  
Compared to [LoadFromFileAsync](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetBundle.LoadFromFileAsync.html), this version is synchronous and will not return until it is done creating the AssetBundle object.  
  
This is the fastest way to load an AssetBundle.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using System.IO;  
  
public class LoadFromFileExample : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        var myLoadedAssetBundle = AssetBundle.LoadFromFile[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetBundle.LoadFromFile.html)(Path.Combine(Application.streamingAssetsPath[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-streamingAssetsPath.html), "myassetBundle"));
        if (myLoadedAssetBundle == null)
        {
            Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Failed to load AssetBundle[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetBundle.html)!");
            return;
        }  
  
        var prefab = myLoadedAssetBundle.LoadAsset<GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html)>("MyObject");
        Instantiate(prefab);  
  
        myLoadedAssetBundle.Unload(false);
    }
}

```
