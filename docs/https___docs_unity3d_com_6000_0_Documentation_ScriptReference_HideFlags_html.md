### Description
Bit mask that controls object destruction, saving and visibility in inspectors.
Additional resources: [Object.hideFlags](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Object-hideFlags.html).
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Creates a material that is explicitly created & destroyed by the component.
    // Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.html) will not unload it, and it will not be editable by the inspector.
    private Material[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html) ownedMaterial;
    void OnEnable()
    {
        ownedMaterial = new Material[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html)(Shader.Find[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Shader.Find.html)("Diffuse"));
        ownedMaterial.hideFlags = HideFlags.HideAndDontSave[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.HideAndDontSave.html);
        GetComponent<Renderer[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer.html)>().sharedMaterial = ownedMaterial;
    }  
  
    // Objects created as hide and don't save must be explicitly destroyed by the owner of the object.
    void OnDisable()
    {
        DestroyImmediate(ownedMaterial);
    }
}

```

If you set `HideFlags` to `DontSaveInEditor`, `DontSaveInBuild`, or `HideInHierarchy`, the object is removed internally from the Scene and from from its current physics scene. This includes both 2D and 3D physics scenes. The object also triggers its `OnDisable` and `OnEnable` calls.   
  
You can use these flags to control whether instantiated assets, such as ScriptableObjects and Materials, that have not yet been saved to the project using [AssetDatabase](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetDatabase.html) (that is, they are not persistent) are serialized to the scene or not. 
### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[None](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.None.html) | A normal, visible object. This is the default.  
[HideInHierarchy](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.HideInHierarchy.html) | The object will not appear in the hierarchy.  
[HideInInspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.HideInInspector.html) | It is not possible to view it in the inspector.  
[DontSaveInEditor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.DontSaveInEditor.html) | The object will not be saved to the Scene in the editor.  
[NotEditable](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.NotEditable.html) | The object is not editable in the Inspector.  
[DontSaveInBuild](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.DontSaveInBuild.html) | The object will not be saved when building a player.  
[DontUnloadUnusedAsset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.DontUnloadUnusedAsset.html) | The object will not be unloaded by Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.  
[DontSave](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.DontSave.html) | The object will not be saved to the Scene. It will not be destroyed when a new Scene is loaded. It is a shortcut for HideFlags.DontSaveInBuild | HideFlags.DontSaveInEditor | HideFlags.DontUnloadUnusedAsset.  
[HideAndDontSave](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HideFlags.HideAndDontSave.html) | The GameObject is not shown in the Hierarchy, not saved to the Scene, and not unloaded by Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.
