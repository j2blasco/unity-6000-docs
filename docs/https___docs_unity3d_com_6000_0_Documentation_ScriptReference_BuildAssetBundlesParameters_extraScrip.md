extraScriptingDefines; 
### Description
User-specified preprocessor defines used while compiling assemblies during the AssetBundle build. (optional)
Preprocessor defines may be used to exclude serialized fields from class definitions, so this can be have an influence on how objects are serialized during the build process. Typically value passed here should match any extra scripting defines passed during the player build.
