Set up multiple scenes
# Work with multiple scenes in Unity
If you need to create large streaming worlds or want to effectively manage multiple **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) at runtime, you can open and edit multiple scenes in the Unity Editor simultaneously. Having multiple scenes open at once also lets you improve the workflow, especially if you often have to edit scenes collaboratively.

[**Bake data in multiple scenes**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/bakemultiplescenes.html) | How to bake **lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that contains the effects of light sources on static objects in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the effect of lighting. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Lightmap), **NavMesh** A mesh that Unity generates to approximate the walkable areas and obstacles in your environment for path finding and AI-controlled navigation.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#NavMesh) data, and **occlusion culling** A process that disables rendering GameObjects that are hidden (occluded) from the view of the camera.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Occlusionculling) data in multiple scenes simultaneously.  
[**Use scripts to edit multiple scenes**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scriptmultiplescenes.html) | How to edit multiple scenes with **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts), through the Editor or at runtime.
