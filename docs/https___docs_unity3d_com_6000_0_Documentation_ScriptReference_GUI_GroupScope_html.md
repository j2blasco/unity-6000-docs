### Description
Disposable helper class for managing [BeginGroup](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.BeginGroup.html) / [EndGroup](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.EndGroup.html).
[BeginGroup](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.BeginGroup.html) is called at construction, and [EndGroup](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.EndGroup.html) is called when the instance is disposed. When you begin a group, the coordinate system for GUI controls are set so (0,0) is the top-left corner of the group. All controls are clipped to the group. Groups can be nested - if they are, children are clipped to their parents.  
  
This is very useful when moving a bunch of GUI elements around on screen. A common use case is designing your menus to fit on a specific screen size, then centering the GUI on larger displays.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnGUI()
    {
        // Constrain all drawing to be within a 800x600 pixel area centered on the screen.
        using (var groupScope = new GUI.GroupScope[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.GroupScope.html)(new Rect[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html)(Screen.width[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Screen-width.html) / 2 - 400, Screen.height[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Screen-height.html) / 2 - 300, 800, 600)))
        {
            // Draw a box in the new coordinate space defined by the BeginGroup.
            // Notice how (0,0) has now been moved on-screen.
            GUI.Box[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.Box.html)(new Rect[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html)(0, 0, 800, 600), "This box is now centered! - here you would put your main menu");
        }
        // The group is now ended.
    }
}
