# Device Simulator for iOS
Unity’s [Device Simulator](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/device-simulator.html) can simulate the appearance and behavior of a variety of iOS devices. This helps you test basic interactions and view the layout of your application on iOS devices. This reduces costs, because you don’t need to own a device to simulate it, and helps you to improve device coverage. Additionally, the Device Simulator doesn’t require you to build your application which means you can debug layout issues and iterate quickly.
The Device Simulator doesn’t simulate the graphics back end of the target device and renders your application in the same way that the Unity Editor does. This means that it doesn’t impose limitations that the graphics back end of the target device might have. The Device Simulator also doesn’t simulate the performance characteristics of the device, so to profile your application, you must create a build and run it directly on the device. To understand how to profile your iOS device, refer to [Collecting performance data on an iOS device](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ios-profile-device.html). For more information on the capabilities and limitations of the Device Simulator, refer to [Device Simulator introduction](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/device-simulator-introduction.html).
The Device Simulator includes a variety of iOS devices, but you can also add other devices if necessary. For information on how to do this, refer to [Add a device](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/device-simulator-adding-a-device.html).

The app connects with Unity while you are running your project in Play Mode from the Unity Editor. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UnityRemote5.html)
