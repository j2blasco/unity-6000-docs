### Description
Set this to true to use the [adjacentStartPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EdgeCollider2D-adjacentStartPoint.html) to form the collision normal that is used to calculate the collision response when a collision occurs at the Edge Collider's start point. Set this to false to not use the [adjacentStartPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EdgeCollider2D-adjacentStartPoint.html), and the collision normal becomes the direction of motion of the collision.
