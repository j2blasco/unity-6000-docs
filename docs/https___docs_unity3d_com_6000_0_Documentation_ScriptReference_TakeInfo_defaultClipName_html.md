defaultClipName; 
### Description
This is the default clip name for the clip generated for this take.
Normally it should be the same than [TakeInfo.name](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TakeInfo-name.html) unless you are using the @ convention. In this case the default clip name should be set to the same value than the name after @ convention. Example: For Dude@run.fbx the default clip name will be run.
