Applying 2D billboards for low LOD meshes
# 2D images for low level of detail (LOD)
Techniques and resources for using 2D **billboards** A textured 2D object that rotates so that it always faces the Camera. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-BillboardRenderer.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Billboard) to simplify 3D meshes that are far away.

---|---  
[Applying 2D billboards for low LOD meshes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/applying-2d-billboards-low-lod-meshes.html) | Understand how Unity uses Billboard Renderers and Billboard assets to create a 2D billboard for low-LOD rendering.  
[Billboard Renderer component reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-BillboardRenderer.html) | Explore the properties in the Billboard Renderer to to customize how Unity renders billboards and their interaction with lighting.  
[Billboard asset reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-BillboardAsset.html) | Explore the properties in the Billboard asset.  
## Render pipeline information
How you work with billboards depends on the **render pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) you use.

---|---|---|---  
**Billboard Renderer component** | Yes. | Yes.
