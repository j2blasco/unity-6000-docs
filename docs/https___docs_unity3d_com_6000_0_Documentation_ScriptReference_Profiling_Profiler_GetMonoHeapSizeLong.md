## Declaration
public static long GetMonoHeapSizeLong(); 
### Returns
**long** The size of the managed heap. 
### Description
Returns the size of the reserved space for managed-memory.
This will grow when the total allocated managed-memory exceeds the currently reserved amount. The size of the reserved space for managed allocations, will also have an effect on how frequent the garbage collector will run, and how long it takes to make a garbage collection. The larger the heap, the longer it takes, but the less often it will run.  
  
**Note** : This API is available even when the rest of Profiler class is not available (ie, in release builds).
