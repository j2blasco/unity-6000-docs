Introduction to cameras
# Cameras
Resources and approaches for using **cameras** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) to view and render a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) in Unity.

[Using multiple cameras](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/MultipleCameras-landing.html) | Resources and approaches for using more than one camera in a scene.  
[Changing resolution scale](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/resolution-scale.html) | Techniques for improving performance by rendering at a lower resolution.  
[Excluding hidden objects with occlusion culling](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/OcclusionCulling-landing.html) | Resources about preventing Unity doing rendering calculations for hidden **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject).  
[Simulating real-world cameras with Physical Cameras](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PhysicalCameras.html) | Resources and techniques for using a Physical Camera component, which uses the camera settings as most 3D modeling applications.

Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).
