[Switch to Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LensFlare.html "Go to LensFlare page in the Scripting Reference")
Explore the properties in the **Lens Flare** component to create a lens flare with a [Flare asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Flare.html).
**_Property:_** | **_Function:_**  
---|---  
**Flare** | The [Flare asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Flare.html) to render.  
  
**Note** : The other properties in the Lens Flare Inspector are stored in this Flare asset. They are not stored in the Lens Flare component.  
**Color** | The color to tint the Flare to. You can use this to make the lens flare better fit the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene)’s mood.  
**Brightness** | The size and brightness the lens flare appears. If you use a very bright lens flare, make sure its direction fits with your Scene’s primary light source. Can only affect properties that Flare has enabled.  
**Fade Speed** | The speed at which Unity fades the lens flare in and out.  
**Ignore Layers** | A mask that determins which Layers can see the lens flare.  
**Directional** | Indicates whether Unity orients the Flare along the positive z-axis of the **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject). It appears as if it was infinitely far away, and does not track the GameObject’s position, only the direction of its z-axis.
