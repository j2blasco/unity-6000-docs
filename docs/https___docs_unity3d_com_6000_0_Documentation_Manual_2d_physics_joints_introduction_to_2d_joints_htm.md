# Introduction to 2D joints
2D joints are the 2D counterparts of the 3D **joint** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint) physics components, and are made to work only with 2D GameObjects. You can only attach 2D joints to GameObjects which have an attached **Rigidbody** A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Rigidbody) 2D component, or to a fixed position in world space. A 2D joint connects a Rigidbody 2D **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) to another Rigidbody 2D GameObject. 2D joints can apply forces that move Rigidbody GameObjects, and joint limits can restrict that movement.
You can tell a 2D joint from its 3D counterpart in the [Component browser](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingComponents.html) by its name ending in ‘2D’.
There are many different types of 2D joints available. Refer to each joint’s respective page for detailed information about their properties and uses. These can be found in the [2D Joints](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/2d-joints-landing.html) section.
