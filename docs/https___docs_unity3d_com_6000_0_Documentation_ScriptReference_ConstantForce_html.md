### Description
A force applied constantly.
This is a small physics utility class used to apply a continous force to an object.  
  
[Rigidbody.AddForce](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html) applies a force to the [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) only for one frame, thus you have to keep calling the function. ConstantForce on the other hand will apply the force every frame until you change the force or torque to a new value.  
  
Additional resources: [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html).
