cullingMask; 
### Description
This is used to render parts of the Scene selectively.
For example if a [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html)'s `layer` is set to 2, and the second bit of the camera's `cullingMask` is set to zero, the GameObject will be invisible to the camera. See [Layers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Layers.html) for more information.
