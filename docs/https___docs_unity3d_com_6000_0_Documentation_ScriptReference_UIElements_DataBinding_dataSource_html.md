dataSource; 
### Description
Object that serves as a local source for the binding, and is particularly useful when the data source is not part of the UI hierarchy, such as a static localization table. If this object is null, the binding resolves the data source using its normal resolution method. 
Using a local source does not prevent children of the target from using the hierarchy source.
