[GradientMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GradientMode.html) mode; 
### Description
Controls how the gradient colors are interpolated.
The default interpolation mode is [GradientMode.Blend](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GradientMode.Blend.html). Note that [GradientMode.PerceptualBlend](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GradientMode.PerceptualBlend.html) can often result in a more natural looking color blend, especially between very different colors. It is slightly more expensive to calculate than the default Blend mode.
