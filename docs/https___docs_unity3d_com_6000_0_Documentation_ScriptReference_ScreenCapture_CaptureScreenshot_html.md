## Declaration
public static void CaptureScreenshot(string filename, int superSize); 
## Declaration
public static void CaptureScreenshot(string filename, [ScreenCapture.StereoScreenCaptureMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ScreenCapture.StereoScreenCaptureMode.html) stereoCaptureMode); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
filename | The path to save the screenshot file to.  
superSize | The factor to increase resolution with.  
stereoCaptureMode | The eye texture to capture when stereo rendering is enabled.  
### Description
Captures a screenshot and saves it as a .png file to a specified path.
If the screenshot exists already, `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot` overwrites it with a new screenshot.  
  
Add `.png` to the end of `filename` to save the screenshot as a .png file.  
  
On mobile platforms, `filename` is appended to the persistent data path. Refer to [Application.persistentDataPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html) for more information on persistent data paths.  
  
On platforms that aren't mobile, `filename` is a file path relative to the executable directory. In the Editor, `filename` is a filepath relative to the project directory.  
  
When the `superSize` parameter is more than 1, a larger resolution screenshot is produced. For example, if you pass 4, you create a screenshot 4x4 larger than normal. This is useful to produce screenshots you want to print.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
// Generate a screenshot and save it to disk with the name SomeLevel.png.  
  
public class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnMouseDown()
    {
        ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot.html)("SomeLevel.png");
    }
}

```

The [CaptureScreenshot](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot.html) returns immediately on Android. The screen capture continues in the background. The resulting screen shot is saved in the file system after a few seconds.
