niceMouseDeltaZoom; 
### Description
Get nice mouse delta to use for zooming (Read Only).
This will autodetect the users preference for X / Y axis dragging and give you back a float that is measured accordingly. This also handles modifier keys correctly, i.e. the delta is already multiplied by [acceleration](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HandleUtility-acceleration.html).
