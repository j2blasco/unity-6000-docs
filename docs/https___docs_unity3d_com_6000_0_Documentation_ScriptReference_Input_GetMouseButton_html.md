## Declaration
public static bool GetMouseButton(int button); 
### Description
Returns whether the given mouse button is held down.
**Note** : This API is part of the legacy Input Manager. The recommended best practice is that you don't use this API in new projects. For new projects, use the Input System package. To learn more about input, refer to [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Input.html).  
  
The _button_ values are: 0 for the left button, 1 for the right button, 2 for the middle button. The return is `true` when the mouse button is pressed down, and `false` when released.
