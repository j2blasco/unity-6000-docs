### Description
AssetPostprocessor lets you hook into the import pipeline and run scripts prior or after importing assets.
During model import the functions are called in the the following order: 
  * [OnPreprocessModel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessModel.html) is called at the very beginning and you can override [ModelImporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporter.html) settings that are used for the whole model import process.
  * After Meshes and Materials are imported, the GameObjects hierarchy is created from the imported nodes. Use [OnPostprocessMeshHierarchy](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessMeshHierarchy.html) to change the hierarchy. Every GameObject that represents an imported node is given a corresponding MeshFilter, MeshRenderer, and MeshCollider component. Before assigning a Material to the MeshRenderer, the [OnAssignMaterialModel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnAssignMaterialModel.html) function is invoked.
  * After GameObject has initialized MeshRenderers and "userdata" exists [OnPostprocessGameObjectWithUserProperties](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessGameObjectWithUserProperties.html) is called. That happens before children GameObjects are generated.
  * If animation generation was not disabled at previous stages (see [ModelImporter.generateAnimations](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ModelImporter-generateAnimations.html)), then SkinnedMesh and Animations are generated. If possible Avatar is also created and GameObjecs hierarchy is optimized. After that [OnPostprocessModel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessModel.html) is called for the root GameObject.


[OnPreprocessSpeedTree](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessSpeedTree.html) and [OnPostprocessSpeedTree](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessSpeedTree.html) are called on SpeedTree assets (.spm file) the same way as [OnPreprocessModel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessModel.html) and [OnPostprocessModel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessModel.html), except that the [assetImporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor-assetImporter.html) type is [SpeedTreeImporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter.html).
