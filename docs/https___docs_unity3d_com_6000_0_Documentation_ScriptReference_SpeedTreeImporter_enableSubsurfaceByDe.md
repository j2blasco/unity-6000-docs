enableSubsurfaceByDefault; 
### Description
Gets and sets a boolean to enable the subsurface scattering effect for the SpeedTree asset (affects only SpeedTree v8 assets).
This setting controls the light scattered out the back side of leaves and other two-sided SpeedTree materials to simulate a translucent surface.  
  
To change this setting for a specific LOD, see [SpeedTreeImporter.enableSubsurface](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter-enableSubsurface.html) and [SpeedTreeImporter.enableSettingOverride](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter-enableSettingOverride.html).
