### Description
Start the Player with a connection to the Profiler in the Editor.
When the build starts, an open Profiler window automatically connects to the Player and starts profiling. When you build the Player by enabling the [BuildOptions.AutoRunPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildOptions.AutoRunPlayer.html) option, the Editor automatically opens the Profiler window.
