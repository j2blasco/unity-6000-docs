[Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) adjacentEndPoint; 
### Description
Defines the position of a virtual point adjacent to the end point of the EdgeCollider2D.
An EdgeCollider2D is made up of contiguous edges defined by a set of points adjacent to each other. When a collision occurs with a point along the Collider, Unity uses the two edges the point makes with its adjacent points to form a collision normal, and calculate the collision response. This produces a continuous edge chain and an uninterrupted collision surface.  
  
However, when a collision occurs with the start or end point of the Edge Collider, Unity is unable to form a collision normal with a single edge and so the collision normal becomes the direction of motion of the collision.  
  
This property defines a virtual point that is adjacent to the end point to create a "virtual edge" from which Unity calculates and forms a collision normal. This point is only used when [useAdjacentEndPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EdgeCollider2D-useAdjacentEndPoint.html) it set to true. The "virtual edge‚Äù formed cannot be collided with and only a collision normal is used  
  
An important and useful use case for this feature is to allow multiple [EdgeCollider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EdgeCollider2D.html)s to connect together by specifying [adjacentStartPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EdgeCollider2D-adjacentStartPoint.html) and [adjacentEndPoint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EdgeCollider2D-adjacentEndPoint.html) that overlap the points of other [EdgeCollider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EdgeCollider2D.html)s. This produces a seamless transition for collisions when moving across multiple [EdgeCollider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EdgeCollider2D.html)s.
