[ArticulationBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html) articulationBody; 
### Description
The [ArticulationBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html) of the collider that your GameObject collides with (Read Only).
This returns the [ArticulationBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html) of the collider that your GameObject collides with. If the collider doesn't have an articulation body attached, this returns `null`.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Make all articulation bodies that your GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) hits fly upwards
    void OnCollisionStay(Collision[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html) collision)
    {
        // Check if the collider your GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) hits has an articulation body
        // Then apply the force
        if (collision.articulationBody)
        {
            collision.articulationBody.AddForce(Vector3.up[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-up.html) * 15);
        }
    }
}
