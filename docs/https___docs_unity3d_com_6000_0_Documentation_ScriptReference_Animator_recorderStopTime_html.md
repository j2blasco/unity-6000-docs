recorderStopTime; 
### Description
End time of the recorded clip relative to when [StartRecording](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animator.StartRecording.html) was called.
For example, if we started recording at second 10, and ended recording at second 15, then this will have a value of 5. If the buffer is not initialized ([StartRecording](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animator.StartRecording.html) is not called), the value of this property will be -1. Additional resources: [recorderStartTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animator-recorderStartTime.html).
