### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
gameObject | The GameObject with animated custom properties.  
bindings | The animation curves bound to the custom properties.  
### Description
This function is called when the animation curves for a custom property are finished importing.
It is called for every GameObject with an animated custom property. Each animated property has an animation curve that is represented by an [EditorCurveBinding](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorCurveBinding.html). This lets you dynamically add components to a GameObject and retarget the EditorCurveBindings to any animatable property.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html);  
  
class MyAllPostprocessor : AssetPostprocessor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.html)
{
    void OnPostprocessGameObjectWithAnimatedUserProperties(GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) go, EditorCurveBinding[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorCurveBinding.html)[] bindings)
    {
        // add a particle emitter to every game object that has a custom property called "particleAmount"
        // then map the animation to the emission rate
        for (int i = 0; i < bindings.Length; i++)
        {
            if (bindings[i].propertyName == "particlesAmount")
            {
                ParticleSystem[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.html) emitter = go.AddComponent<ParticleSystem[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.html)>();
                var emission = emitter.emission;
                emission.rateOverTimeMultiplier = 0;  
  
                bindings[i].propertyName = "EmissionModule.rateOverTime.scalar";
                bindings[i].path = AnimationUtility.CalculateTransformPath[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationUtility.CalculateTransformPath.html)(go.transform, go.transform.root);
                bindings[i].type = typeof(ParticleSystem[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.html));
            }
        }
    }
}
