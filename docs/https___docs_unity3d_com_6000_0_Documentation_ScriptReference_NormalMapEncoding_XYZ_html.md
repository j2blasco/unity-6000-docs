### Description
Three-component normal map encoding.
This is the default normal map encoding on mobile platforms.  
  
Compared to [NormalMapEncoding.DXT5nm](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/NormalMapEncoding.DXT5nm.html), the normal maps are of lower quality, but are less computationally expensive to decode in shaders.
