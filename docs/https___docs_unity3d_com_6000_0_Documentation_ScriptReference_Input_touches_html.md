touches; 
### Description
Returns list of objects representing status of all touches during last frame. (Read Only) (Allocates temporary variables).
**Note** : This API is part of the legacy Input Manager. The recommended best practice is that you don't use this API in new projects. For new projects, use the Input System package. To learn more about input, refer to [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Input.html).  
  
Each entry represents a status of a finger touching the screen.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Prints number of fingers touching the screen
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        var fingerCount = 0;
        foreach (Touch[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Touch.html) touch in Input.touches[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input-touches.html))
        {
            if (touch.phase != TouchPhase.Ended[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TouchPhase.Ended.html) && touch.phase != TouchPhase.Canceled[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TouchPhase.Canceled.html))
            {
                fingerCount++;
            }
        }
        if (fingerCount > 0)
        {
            print("User has " + fingerCount + " finger(s) touching the screen");
        }
    }
}
