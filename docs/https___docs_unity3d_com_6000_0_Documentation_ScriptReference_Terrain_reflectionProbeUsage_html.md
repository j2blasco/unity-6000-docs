[Rendering.ReflectionProbeUsage](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.ReflectionProbeUsage.html) reflectionProbeUsage; 
### Description
How reflection probes are used for terrain. See [ReflectionProbeUsage](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.ReflectionProbeUsage.html).
If enabled and reflection probes are present in the Scene, a reflection texture will be picked for the terrain object and set as a uniform for the shader.   
Not applicable to materials using built-in Legacy shaders.
