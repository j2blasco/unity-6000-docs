useGUILayout; 
### Description
Disabling this lets you skip the GUI layout phase.
It can only be used if you do not use [GUI.Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.Window.html) and GUILayout inside of this OnGUI call.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public void Start()
    {
        //Disabling this lets you skip the GUI[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.html) layout phase.
        useGUILayout = false;
    }
}
