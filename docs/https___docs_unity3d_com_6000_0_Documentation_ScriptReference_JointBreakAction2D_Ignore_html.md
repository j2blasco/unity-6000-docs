### Description
When the [Joint2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.html) breaks, no action will be taken and [Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D.html) will not be called.
This option effectively disables any joint breaking and will ignore any [Joint2D.breakForce](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D-breakForce.html) or [Joint2D.breakTorque](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Joint2D-breakTorque.html).
