## Declaration
public static bool RenderToCubemap([Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) camera, [Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.html) target, int faceMask, [StaticEditorFlags](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/StaticEditorFlags.html) culledFlags); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
camera | The Camera to use during rendering.  
target | The cubemap to render to.  
faceMask | A bitmask which determines which of the six faces to render to.  
culledFlags | The flags of objects to cull during rendering.  
### Returns
**bool** If the render process succeeds, returns `true`. Otherwise, returns `false`. 
### Description
Renders this Camera into a static cubemap.
This function is mostly useful in the editor for "baking" static cubemaps of your Scene.  
  
This functions uses the Camera's Clear Flags, its Transformâ€™s Position, and its Clipping Plane distances to render sections of the Scene into each cubemap face. `faceMask` is a bitfield indicating which cubemap faces to render into. Each set bit corresponds to a face. Bit numbers are integer values of [CubemapFace](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CubemapFace.html) enum type. By default, this process renders to all six cubemap faces (the default value of 63 means the lowest six bits are set. `false`). This function returns `false` if rendering to the cubemap fails. An example of how this could happen is that some graphics hardware does not support this functionality. Note: ReflectionProbes are a more advanced method of performing real-time reflections. Note: You can create cubemaps in the Editor by navigating to **Assets >Create>Legacy** and selecting **Cubemap** option.
