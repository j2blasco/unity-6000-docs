areaCount; 
### Description
The number of [Profiler Areas](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.ProfilerArea.html) that you can profile.
This number is build constant right now, as [ProfilerArea](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.ProfilerArea.html) is an enum. Try not to rely on it staying the same throughout the lifetime of the editor instance though, as this is prone to change in the future.
