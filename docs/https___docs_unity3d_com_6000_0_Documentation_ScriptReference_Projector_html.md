### Description
A script interface for a [projector component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Projector.html).
The Projector can be used to project any material onto the Scene - just like a real world projector. The properties exposed by this class are an exact match for the values in the Projector's inspector.  
  
It can be used to implement blob or projected shadows. You could also project an animated texture or a render texture that films another part of the Scene. The projector will render all objects in its view frustum with the provided material.  
  
There is no shortcut property in [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) or [Component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.html) to access the Projector, so you must use [GetComponent](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.GetComponent.html) to do it:
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Get the projector
        Projector[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Projector.html) proj = GetComponent<Projector[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Projector.html)>();
        // Use it
        proj.nearClipPlane = 0.5f;
    }
}

```
