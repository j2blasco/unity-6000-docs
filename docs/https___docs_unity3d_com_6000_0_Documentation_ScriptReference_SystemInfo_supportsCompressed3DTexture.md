supportsCompressed3DTextures; 
### Description
Are compressed formats for 3D (volume) textures supported? (Read Only).
Not all graphics APIs and platforms support compressed [Texture3D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture3D.html) textures, for example Metal on macOS before 10.15 does not.
