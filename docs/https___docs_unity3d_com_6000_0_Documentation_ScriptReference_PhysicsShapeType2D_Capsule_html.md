### Description
Use a capsule shape to interpret the [PhysicsShape2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D.html) geometry.
A capsule geometry type is comprised of two vertices in the [PhysicsShape2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D.html) and a [PhysicsShape2D.radius](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D-radius.html). The two vertices represent the centers of the two ends of a capsule shape with the radius defining the circular end radius.
