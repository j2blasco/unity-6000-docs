Creating a URP project
# Installing and upgrading URP
Create a project that uses the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP), or upgrade to URP from the Built-In Render Pipeline.

[Creating a URP project](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/creating-a-urp-project.html) | Resources for creating a new project that uses URP, or installing URP into an existing project that uses the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Upgrading from the Built-In Render Pipeline to URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/upgrading-from-birp.html) | Resources for using the Render Pipeline Converter to upgrade a project to URP, and match quality settings from the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Upgrade URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/upgrade-guides.html) | Upgrade from an older version of URP to a more recent version, or upgrade from the Lightweight Render Pipeline (LWRP).  
[Known issues](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/known-issues.html) | Solve common issues with URP, such as long build times in the Forward+ **rendering path** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#RenderingPath), or incorrect rendering in the URP package samples.
