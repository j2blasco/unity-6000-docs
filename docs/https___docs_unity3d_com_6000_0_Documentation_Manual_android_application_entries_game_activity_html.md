# The GameActivity application entry point
The [GameActivity](https://developer.android.com/games/agdk/game-activity) application entry point is an extension of the [Activity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/android-application-entries-activity.html) application entry point and is the default application entry point for new Unity projects. It provides more control over the interaction between Android and your application than the Activity application entry point. To provide this control, the GameActivity library does the following:
  * It doesnâ€™t directly map to a specific Unity version which means you can update the GameActivity library separately to Unity.
  * It uses a customizable [glue library](https://developer.android.com/reference/games/game-activity/group/android-native-app-glue) as a bridge between itself and Unity. This means you can modify the bridge code to make changes and extend functionality.
