# Scripting
Scripting in Unity refers to authoring your project’s functionality in code rather than through the Unity Editor UI. This allows you to go beyond what can be done in the Editor UI alone. Interacting directly with the public Unity APIs allows for finer control and a greater degree of customization.
Learning to program in particular languages is beyond the scope of this section. However, there are many books, tutorials, and other resources for learning how to program with Unity. Refer to [learn](http://unity3d.com/learn) for further details.
