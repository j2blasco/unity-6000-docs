### Description
Start the player with a connection to the profiler.
When the build is started, an open Profiler Window will automatically connect to the Player and start profiling. When the Player is build with the [BuildOptions.AutoRunPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildOptions.AutoRunPlayer.html) option enabled, the Editor will also automatically open the Profiler Window. You can also set this property in the Unity Editor using the [Autoconnect Profiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/build-profiles-reference.html#shared-build-settings) setting on the **Build Profiles** window.
