[SpriteMeshType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpriteMeshType.html) spriteMeshType; 
### Description
[SpriteMeshType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpriteMeshType.html) defines the type of Mesh that [TextureImporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporter.html) generates for a Sprite.
When [SpriteMeshType.FullRect](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpriteMeshType.FullRect.html) is specified, it will generate a rectangle Mesh equal to the user specified Sprite size.  
  
When [SpriteMeshType.Tight](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpriteMeshType.Tight.html) is specified, it will generate a tight Mesh based on pixel alpha values.
