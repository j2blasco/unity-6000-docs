### Description
Sets the spread angle (in degrees) of a 3d stereo or multichannel sound in speaker space.
0 = all sound channels are located at the same speaker location and is 'mono'. 360 = all subchannels are located at the opposite speaker location to the speaker location that it should be according to 3D position. Default = 0.

    // when any AudioSource[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioSource.html) goes trough this transform, it will set it as 'mono'
    // and will restore the value to 3D effect after exiting
    // Make sure the audio source has a collider.
