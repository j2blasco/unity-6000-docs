## Declaration
public void RotateAround([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) point, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) axis, float angle); 
### Description
Rotates the transform about `axis` passing through `point` in world coordinates by `angle` degrees.
This modifies both the position and the rotation of the transform.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
//Attach this script to a GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) to rotate around the target position.
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    //Assign a GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) in the Inspector to rotate around
    public GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) target;  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        // Spin the object around the target at 20 degrees/second.
        transform.RotateAround(target.transform.position, Vector3.up[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-up.html), 20 * Time.deltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html));
    }
}
