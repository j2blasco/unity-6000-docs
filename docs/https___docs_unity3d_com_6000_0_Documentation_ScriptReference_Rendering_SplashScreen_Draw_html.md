## Declaration
public static void Draw(); 
### Description
Immediately draws the splash screen. Ensure you have called [SplashScreen.Begin](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.SplashScreen.Begin.html) before you start calling this.
```
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
  
// This example shows how you could draw the splash screen at the start of a Scene[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.Scene.html). This is a good way to integrate the splash screen with your own or add extras such as Audio.
public class SplashScreenExample : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    IEnumerator Start()
    {
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Showing splash screen");
        SplashScreen.Begin[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.SplashScreen.Begin.html)();
        while (!SplashScreen.isFinished[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.SplashScreen-isFinished.html))
        {
            SplashScreen.Draw[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.SplashScreen.Draw.html)();
            yield return null;
        }
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Finished showing splash screen");
    }
}
