### Description
Picking enabled. Default Value. Performs picking based on the position rectangle. In the VisualElement tree hierarchy, the picking process works using a similar logic as the rendering but in reverse order: it starts with the front-most elements and proceeds step by step towards background elements. Thus, the child elements are picked before parents, and the sibling elements further down the list are picked before their predecessors.
