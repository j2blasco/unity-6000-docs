lightmapMaxSize; 
### Description
The maximum size in pixels of an individual lightmap texture. (Editor only).
The default value is 1024. Values are squared, so a value of 1024 results in a maximum resolution of 1024 x 1024. Smaller lightmaps might also be generated instead. This happens if it is possible to fit the required UVs into a smaller texture.  
  
This setting affects lightmaps generated by the Baked Global Illumination system.  
  
When Unity serializes this `LightingSettings` object as a [Lighting Settings Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-LightingSettings.html), this property corresponds to the **Max Lightmap Size** property in the Lighting Settings Asset Inspector.
