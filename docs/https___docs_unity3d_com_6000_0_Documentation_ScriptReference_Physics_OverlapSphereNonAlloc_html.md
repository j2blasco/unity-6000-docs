## Declaration
public static int OverlapSphereNonAlloc([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) position, float radius, Collider[] results, int layerMask = AllLayers, [QueryTriggerInteraction](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QueryTriggerInteraction.html) queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
position | Center of the sphere.  
radius | Radius of the sphere.  
results | The buffer to store the results into.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Layers.html) defines which layers of colliders to include in the query.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
### Returns
**int** Returns the amount of colliders stored into the `results` buffer. 
### Description
Computes and stores colliders touching or inside the sphere into the provided buffer.
Does not attempt to grow the buffer if it runs out of space. The length of the buffer is returned when the buffer is full. Like [Physics.OverlapSphere](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.OverlapSphere.html), but generates no garbage.

        int numColliders = Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc.html)(center, radius, hitColliders);
        for (int i = 0; i < numColliders; i++)
        {
            hitColliders[i].SendMessage("AddDamage");
        }
    }
}
