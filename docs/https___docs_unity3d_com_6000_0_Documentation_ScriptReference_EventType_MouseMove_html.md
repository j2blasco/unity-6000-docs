### Description
Mouse was moved (Editor views only).
The mouse was moved without any buttons being held down. Use [Event.mousePosition](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Event-mousePosition.html) and [Event.delta](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Event-delta.html) to determine mouse motion.  
  
Note that this event is only sent in the Editor for [EditorWindow](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorWindow.html) windows which have [EditorWindow.wantsMouseMove](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorWindow-wantsMouseMove.html) set to true. Mouse move events are never sent in the games.
