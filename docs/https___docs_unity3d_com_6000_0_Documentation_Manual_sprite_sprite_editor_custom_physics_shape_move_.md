# Move a control point
To adjust the shape of the **Mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Mesh) outline, click and drag the control points. When you hover over a control point, it turns blue to indicate that you can select it. Click and drag the control point to different positions to adjust the shape of the physics shape outline. You can select multiple control points at once by clicking and dragging the cursor over an area to select all control points within that area. You can then re-position or [remove](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-editor/custom-physics-shape/add-remove-control-points.html) all selected control points.
