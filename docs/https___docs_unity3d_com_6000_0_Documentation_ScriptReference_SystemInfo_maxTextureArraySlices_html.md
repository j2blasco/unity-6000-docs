maxTextureArraySlices; 
### Description
Maximum number of slices in a Texture array (Read Only).
This is the largest Texture array size that your graphics hardware supports. Even if a GPU supports a large Texture array size, it might not have enough memory to create it. For example, 256 slices of 2048x2048x256 2D Texture images at 32 bits per pixel requires 4 gigabytes of data to create.
