### Description
OnBecameInvisible is called when the renderer is no longer visible by any camera.
This message is sent to all scripts attached to the renderer. [OnBecameVisible](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnBecameVisible.html) and [OnBecameInvisible](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnBecameInvisible.html) is useful to avoid computations that are only necessary when the object is visible.
```
// Disables the behaviour when it is invisible  
  
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnBecameInvisible()
    {
        enabled = false;
    }
}

```

OnBecameInvisible can be a co-routine, simply use the yield statement in the function. When running in the editor, Scene view cameras will also cause this function to be called.
