### Description
Include video shaders in builds when referenced by scenes.
If a [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) or [VideoClip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoClip.html) is in a scene, video shaders are included in the build.  
  
**Note:** Class references are not inspected during the build. If you create a [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) through scripting and you are not using a [VideoClip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoClip.html), use the [VideoShadersIncludeMode.Always](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.VideoShadersIncludeMode.Always.html) mode.
