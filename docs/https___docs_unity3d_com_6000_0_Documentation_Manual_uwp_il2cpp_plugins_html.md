Use managed UWP plug-ins
# Use UWP plug-ins with IL2CPP
You can use plug-ins to call code created outside of Unity from your C# **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts). The plug-in model for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is similar to other Unity-supported platforms. For more information about plug-ins with Unity, refer to [Plug-ins](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/plug-ins.html)A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Plug-in).
