### Description
Whether motion vectors are supported on this platform.
Will return true on platforms where motion vectors are supported. This means that the target supports [RenderTextureFormat.RGHalf](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureFormat.RGHalf.html) and the configured motion vector shader is supported.
