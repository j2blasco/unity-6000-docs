### Description
Gates control when the dispatcher processes events. 
Here is an example of using a gate:   
  
When the gate is instantiated, it closes automatically, causing the dispatcher to store the events it receives in a queue. At the end of the `using` block, Dispose is called, which triggers opening the gate. When all gates on a dispatcher open, the events stored in the queue are processed. Closing a gate while the event queue is processed does not stop it from being processed. Instead, a new queue is created to store new events.   
  
Here is an example of using a gate: 
```
 public class MyElement : VisualElement[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.VisualElement.html)
 {
     void Foo()
     {
         using (new EventDispatcherGate[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.EventDispatcherGate.html)(dispatcher))
         {
             // do something that sends events
         }
     }
 }

```
