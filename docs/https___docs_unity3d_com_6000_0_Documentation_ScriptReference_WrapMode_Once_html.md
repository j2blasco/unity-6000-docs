### Description
When time reaches the end of the animation clip, the clip will automatically stop playing and time will be reset to beginning of the clip.
Note that when playing backwards and when the time reaches the beginning the clip will automatically stop playing, but the time won't be reset to the end - it will be kept at the beginning.
