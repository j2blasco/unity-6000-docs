# Creating custom shaders that support GPU instancing in the Built-In Render Pipeline
Resources for writing HLSL **shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) or **Surface Shaders** A streamlined way of writing shaders for the Built-in Render Pipeline. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SL-SurfaceShaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SurfaceShader) in the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) that support GPU instancing.
