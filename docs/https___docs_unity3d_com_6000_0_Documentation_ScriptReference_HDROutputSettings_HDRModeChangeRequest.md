### Description
Describes whether the user has requested to change the HDR Output Mode. It is `true` if this is the case, and `false` otherwise.
Accessing this member results in an exception if HDR is not available on the display. Use [HDROutputSettings.available](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HDROutputSettings-available.html) for the display to check that HDR is available.
