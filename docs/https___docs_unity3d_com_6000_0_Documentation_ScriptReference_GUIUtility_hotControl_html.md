hotControl; 
### Description
The controlID of the current hot control.
The hot control is one that is temporarily active. When the user mousedown's on a button, it becomes hot.   
No other controls are allowed to respond to mouse events while some other control is hot.  
once the user mouseup's, the control sets `hotControl` to 0 in order to indicate that other controls can now respond to user input.
```
