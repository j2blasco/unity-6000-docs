## Declaration
public static void LoadProjectionMatrix([Matrix4x4](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Matrix4x4.html) mat); 
### Description
Load an arbitrary matrix to the current projection matrix.
This function overrides current camera's projection parameters, so most often you want to save and restore projection matrix using [GL.PushMatrix](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GL.PushMatrix.html) and [GL.PopMatrix](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GL.PopMatrix.html). The model and view matrix remain unchanged. Beware that the view matrix of the camera typically performs a scaling of -1 along the z axis, which might have to be taken into account depending on your use case.  
  
The loaded projection matrix is expected to project into the API-agnostic clip volume defined by the following boundaries:  
**1.** x = -1..1 (left..right)  
**2.** y = -1..1 (bottom..top)  
**3.** z = -1..1 (near..far)  
  
Unity might combine the matrix with an additional transformation to map to the convention of the actual graphics API. The resulting matrix can be obtained through [GL.GetGPUProjectionMatrix](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GL.GetGPUProjectionMatrix.html).
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    Matrix4x4[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Matrix4x4.html) projMtrx = Matrix4x4.identity[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Matrix4x4-identity.html);  
  
    void OnPostRender()
    {
        GL.PushMatrix[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GL.PushMatrix.html)();
        GL.LoadProjectionMatrix[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GL.LoadProjectionMatrix.html)(projMtrx);
        // Do your drawing here...
        GL.PopMatrix[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GL.PopMatrix.html)();
    }
}
