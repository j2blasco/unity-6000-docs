### Description
Struct used to set up a raycast command to be performed asynchronously during a job.
When you use this struct to schedule a batch of raycasts, they will be performed asynchronously and in parallel to each other. The results of the raycasts are written to the results buffer. Since the results are written asynchronously the results buffer cannot be accessed until the job has been completed.  
  
The results for a command at index N in the command buffer are stored at index N * maxHits in the results buffer.  
  
If maxHits is larger than the actual number of results for the command the result buffer will contain some invalid results which did not hit anything. The first invalid result is identified by the collider being null. The second and later invalid results are not written to by the raycast command so their colliders are not guaranteed to be null. When iterating over the results the loop should stop when the first invalid result is found.  
  
Raycast command also controls whether or not Trigger colliders and back-face triangles generate a hit. If hitMultipleFaces is set to true, Raycast command returns multiple hits per Mesh. You should adjust maxHits and result array size accordingly to store all hits. For solid objects (Sphere, Capsule, Box, Convex), this returns a maximum of one result. Use [QueryParameters](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QueryParameters.html) to control hit flags.  
  
Note: Only BatchQuery.ExecuteRaycastJob is logged into the profiler. Query count information is not logged.
