## Declaration
public bool Contains([Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) point); 
## Declaration
public bool Contains([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) point); 
## Declaration
public bool Contains([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) point, bool allowInverse); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
point | Point to test.  
allowInverse | Does the test allow the Rect's width and height to be negative?  
### Returns
**bool** True if the point lies within the specified rectangle. 
### Description
Returns true if the `x` and `y` components of `point` is a point inside this rectangle. If `allowInverse` is present and true, the width and height of the Rect are allowed to take negative values (ie, the min value is greater than the max), and the test will still work.
