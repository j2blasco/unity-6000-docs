# Fixed Joint 2D
Techniques and resources for working with Fixed **Joint** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint) 2D components.

[Fixed Joint 2D fundamentals](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2d-physics/joints/fixed-joint-2d-fundamentals.html) | Understand the **Fixed Joint** A joint type that is completely constrained, allowing two objects to be held together. Implemented as a spring so some motion may still occur. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-FixedJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#FixedJoint) 2D component and how itâ€™s used to keep two objects in a certain position relative to each other.
