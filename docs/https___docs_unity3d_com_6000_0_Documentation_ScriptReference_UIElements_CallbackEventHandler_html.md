### Description
Interface for classes capable of having callbacks to handle events. 
### Public Methods
Method | Description  
---|---  
[HasBubbleUpHandlers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.CallbackEventHandler.HasBubbleUpHandlers.html) |  Return true if event handlers for the event propagation BubbleUp phase have been attached to this object.   
[HasTrickleDownHandlers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.CallbackEventHandler.HasTrickleDownHandlers.html) |  Returns true if event handlers, for the event propagation TrickleDown phase, are attached to this object.   
[RegisterCallback](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.CallbackEventHandler.RegisterCallback.html) |  Adds an event handler to the instance. If the event handler has already been registered for the same phase (either TrickleDown or BubbleUp) then this method has no effect.   
[RegisterCallbackOnce](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.CallbackEventHandler.RegisterCallbackOnce.html) |  Adds an event handler to the instance. If the event handler has already been registered for the same phase (either TrickleDown or BubbleUp) then this method has no effect. The event handler is automatically unregistered after it has been invoked exactly once.   
[SendEvent](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.CallbackEventHandler.SendEvent.html) |  Sends an event to the event handler.   
[UnregisterCallback](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.CallbackEventHandler.UnregisterCallback.html) |  Remove callback from the instance.   
### Protected Methods
Method | Description  
---|---  
[HandleEventBubbleUp](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.CallbackEventHandler.HandleEventBubbleUp.html) |  Executes logic on this element during the BubbleUp phase, immediately before this element's BubbleUp callbacks. Calling StopPropagation will prevent further invocations of this method along the propagation path.   
[HandleEventTrickleDown](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.CallbackEventHandler.HandleEventTrickleDown.html) |  Executes logic on this element during the TrickleDown phase, immediately after this element's TrickleDown callbacks. Calling StopPropagation will prevent further invocations of this method along the propagation path.   
[NotifyPropertyChanged](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.CallbackEventHandler.NotifyPropertyChanged.html) |  Informs the data binding system that a property of a control has changed.
