### Description
Clear both the color and the depth buffer. This is equivalent to combining [RTClearFlags.Color](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RTClearFlags.Color.html) and [RTClearFlags.Depth](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.RTClearFlags.Depth.html).
