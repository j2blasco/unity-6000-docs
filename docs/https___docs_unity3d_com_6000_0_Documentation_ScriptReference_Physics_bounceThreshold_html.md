bounceThreshold; 
### Description
Two colliding objects with a relative velocity below this will not bounce (default 2). Must be positive.
This value is usually changed in `Edit->Project Settings->Physics` inspector instead of from scripts.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Physics.bounceThreshold[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics-bounceThreshold.html) = 1;
    }
}

```
