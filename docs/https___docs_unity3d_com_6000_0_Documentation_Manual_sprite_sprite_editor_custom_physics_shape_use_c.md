# Use the Custom Physics Shape editor
The Custom Physics Shape editor provides various functions to allow you to create or generate the physics shape of the **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite). There are two ways to create a custom physics shape: have Unity automatically [generate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-editor/custom-physics-shape/generate-physics-shape.html) the shape, or [manually create and edit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-editor/custom-physics-shape/manually-edit-physics-shape.html) it in the editor window.
