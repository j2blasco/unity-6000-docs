### Description
Canvas' order within a sorting layer.
When comparing canvases in the same sorting layer, the one with a higher sorting order is displayed above the one with a lower sorting order. **Note** : Internally the value is stored as a signed 16-bit integer (short) and is constrained within the range of `-32,768` to `32,767`. See [Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer.html).
