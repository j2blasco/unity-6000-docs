[Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html) current; 
### Description
The camera we are currently rendering with, for low-level render control only (Read Only).
Most of the time you will want to use [Camera.main](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-main.html) instead. Use this function only when implementing one of the following events: [MonoBehaviour.OnRenderImage](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnRenderImage.html), [MonoBehaviour.OnPreRender](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnPreRender.html), [MonoBehaviour.OnPostRender](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnPostRender.html).
