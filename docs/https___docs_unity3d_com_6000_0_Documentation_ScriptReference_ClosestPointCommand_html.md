### Description
Struct used to set up a closest point command to be performed asynchronously during a job.  
  
When you use this struct to schedule a batch of closest commands, they are performed asynchronously and in parallel to each other. The results of the closest points are written to the results buffer. Because the results are written asynchronously, the results buffer cannot be accessed until the job has been completed.  
  
The result for a command at index N in the command buffer is stored at index N in the results buffer.
