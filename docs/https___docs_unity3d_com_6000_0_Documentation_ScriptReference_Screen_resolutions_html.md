resolutions; 
### Description
Returns all full-screen resolutions that the monitor supports (Read Only).
Unity returns the resolutions the monitor supports and sorts them by width and then by ascending resolution. **Important:** When you use [FullScreenMode.ExclusiveFullScreen](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FullScreenMode.ExclusiveFullScreen.html) you should use `Screen.resolutions` to determine which resolution to pass to [Screen.SetResolution](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Screen.SetResolution.html) because `FullScreenMode.ExclusiveFullScreen` only works with supported resolutions. If you pass a non-supported resolution, it has a severe impact on performance. All other fullscreen modes support arbitrary resolutions without performance penalties. 
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Resolution[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Resolution.html)[] resolutions = Screen.resolutions[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Screen-resolutions.html);  
  
        // Print the resolutions
        foreach (var res in resolutions)
        {
            Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)(res.width + "x" + res.height + " : " + res.refreshRateRatio);
        }
    }
}

**Note:** On MacOS devices that have a notch area, the resolution array contains resolutions that don't fit under the notch area and will be resized when applied.
