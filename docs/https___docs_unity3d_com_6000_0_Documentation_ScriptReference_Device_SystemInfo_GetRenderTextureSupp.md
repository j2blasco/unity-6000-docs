public static int GetRenderTextureSupportedMSAASampleCount([RenderTextureDescriptor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureDescriptor.html) desc); 
### Description
This has the same functionality as [SystemInfo.GetRenderTextureSupportedMSAASampleCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo.GetRenderTextureSupportedMSAASampleCount.html) and also mimics platform-specific behavior in the Unity Editor.
