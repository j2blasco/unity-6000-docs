### Description
The path where the application will be built.
The path you specify must end with the correct extension for the file format you will build. This path won't be changed by Unity. Set the file format using [EditorUserBuildSettings.buildAppBundle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorUserBuildSettings-buildAppBundle.html).   

  * If your file is an Android Package, end `locationPathName` with `.apk`.
  * If your file is an Android App Bundle, end `locationPathName` with `.aab`.
