### Description
Whether the collider is used by an attached effector or not.
When checked, the [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) continues to work as a collision or trigger area however it will also be used by any [Effector2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Effector2D.html) on the same GameObject.
