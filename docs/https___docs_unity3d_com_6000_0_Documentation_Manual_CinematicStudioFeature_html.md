# Cinematic Studio feature set
**Important:** Support for the Cinematic Studio **feature set** A feature set is a collection of related packages that you can use to achieve specific results in the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in Unity’s Package Manager. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Featureset) is scheduled to end in an upcoming release.
Enable the creation of films, TV shows, and other animated linear content:
  * Organize, assemble, edit and swap your assets in a structured sequence hierarchy.
  * Automate complex **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera) movements and camera shot transitions.
  * Export data for round-trip processing and editorial reviews, and output your final cut.
  * Work with common film industry formats.


## Packages
The Cinematic Studio feature set contains the following packages:
Package | Description  
---|---  
[Timeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.timeline.html) | Author and record cinematic content, gameplay sequences, audio sequences, and complex particle effects. Use Sequences and Cinemachine on top of Timeline to realize your cinematic vision.  
[Sequences](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.sequences.html) | Create editorial structures in Timeline for movies, game cinematics, or any other linear content, and manage your assets in the context of your shots. Benefit from the automation of many Unity Editor processes to focus on your creative content.  
[FBX Exporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.formats.fbx.html) | Export geometry, lights, cameras, and animations to FBX. Enable round-trip workflows between the Unity Editor and 3D modeling applications that support the FBX format. Seamlessly convert **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) to FBX **Prefab** An asset type that allows you to store a GameObject complete with components and properties. The prefab acts as a template from which you can create new object instances in the scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Prefabs.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Prefab) Variants to enable fast iteration on models while maintaining Unity-specific components and overrides.  
[Alembic](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.formats.alembic.html) | Import and export Alembic files, play back and record animations in the Alembic format directly in the Unity Editor. Use the Alembic format for complex vertex animations when skinned meshes can’t provide a high enough quality or are too heavy to process. For example, muscle, skin, and cloth deformations, or fluid, soft-body, hair, and fur movements.  
[Cinemachine](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.cinemachine.html) | Operate the Unity camera in a codeless, procedural way to get sophisticated behaviors: character tracking, **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) composition and interaction, shot evaluations, blends, and cuts. Create, iterate, experiment, and refine camera behaviors and shots in real time. Significantly reduce the number of time-consuming manual manipulations and script revisions that take place during development.  
[Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.recorder.html) | Capture data from Unity Editor’s Play mode and save recordings as image sequences, videos, **animation clips** Animation data that can be used for animated characters or simple animations. It is a simple “unit” piece of motion, such as (one specific instance of) “Idle”, “Walk” or “Run”. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-AnimationClip.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AnimationClip), audio, and arbitrary output variables (AOVs). Use Alembic and FBX Exporter on top of Recorder to export animations as Alembic clips and FBX files. Create game trailers, video content, and intermediate or final output for linear content production.
