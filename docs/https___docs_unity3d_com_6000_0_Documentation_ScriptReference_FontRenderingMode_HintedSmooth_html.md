### Description
Use Anti-Aliased Font rendering with hinting. This forces character lines to run along pixel boundaries.
Generally produces a crisper output than [FontRenderingMode.Smooth](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/FontRenderingMode.Smooth.html), more similar to the font rendering used on Windows. It is slower to render textures then when using smooth mode, but may be easier to read for small font sizes.
