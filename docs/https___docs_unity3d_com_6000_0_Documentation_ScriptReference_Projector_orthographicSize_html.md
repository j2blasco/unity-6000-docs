orthographicSize; 
### Description
Projection's half-size when in orthographic mode.
This is half of the vertical size of the projection volume. Horizontal projection size varies depending on [aspectRatio](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Projector-aspectRatio.html). Orthographic size is ignored when projection is not orthographic (see [orthographic](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Projector-orthographic.html)). Additional resources: [projector component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Projector.html).

        proj.orthographic = true;
        proj.orthographicSize = 2.0f;
