[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) gravity; 
### Description
Returns the gravity acceleration vector expressed in the device's reference frame.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    float movementScale;  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        // A "spirit level" - the dot product of the gravity and the Y axis (ie, Vector3.up[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-up.html))
        // is a measure of how far the device is from level on that axis (it will be zero
        // if the device is perfectly level). This value can be used to position an object
        // to act as the "bubble".
        Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) pos = transform.position;
        pos.y = Vector3.Dot[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.Dot.html)(Input.gyro.gravity, Vector3.up[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-up.html)) * movementScale;
        transform.position = pos;
    }
}
