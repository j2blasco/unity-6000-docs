### Description
Volume extent of a 3D render texture.
For volumetric render textures (see [dimension](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTextureDescriptor-dimension.html)), this variable determines the volume extent. Ignored for non-3D textures. The valid range for 3D textures is 1 to 2000.
