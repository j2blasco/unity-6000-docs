# Change the color of a sprite
The image below demonstrates the effect of changing the RGB values on the ****Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) Renderer’s** Color setting. To change a Sprite’s opacity, change the value of its Color property’s Alpha (A) channel.
