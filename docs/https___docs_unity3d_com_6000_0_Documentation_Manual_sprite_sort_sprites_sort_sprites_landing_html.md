# Sprites sorting order
Unity sorts renderers by several criteria, such as their Layer order or their distance from the **Camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera).
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[**Sort sprites**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sort-sprites/sort-sprites.html) | Sort **sprites** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) based on their position relative to the camera.  
[**Sort sprites using scripts**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sort-sprites/sort-sprites-using-scripts.html) | Sort sprites per camera using **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.
