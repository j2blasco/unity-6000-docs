### Description
Records the changing properties of a [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) as the Scene runs and saves the information into an [AnimationClip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationClip.html).
This class binds [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) properties, records their values as they change in the running Scene, and saves the result in an [AnimationClip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationClip.html). The recorded GameObject is called [root](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animations.GameObjectRecorder-root.html) in the class, and you can also bind the properties of any child of [root](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animations.GameObjectRecorder-root.html).  
  
See the following code example on how this class can be implemented and to set what gets recorded.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor.Animations;  
  
public class RecordTransformHierarchy : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public AnimationClip[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationClip.html) clip;  
  
    private GameObjectRecorder[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animations.GameObjectRecorder.html) m_Recorder;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        // Create recorder and record the script GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html).
        m_Recorder = new GameObjectRecorder[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animations.GameObjectRecorder.html)(gameObject);  
  
        // Bind all the Transforms on the GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) and all its children.
        m_Recorder.BindComponentsOfType<Transform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html)>(gameObject, true);
    }  
  
    void LateUpdate()
    {
        if (clip == null)
            return;  
  
        // Take a snapshot and record all the bindings values for this frame.
        m_Recorder.TakeSnapshot(Time.deltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html));
    }  
  
    void OnDisable()
    {
        if (clip == null)
            return;  
  
        if (m_Recorder.isRecording)
        {
            // Save the recorded session to the clip.
            m_Recorder.SaveToClip(clip);
        }
    }
}
