### Description
This flag enables the use of the Saved Searches workflow in the Search Picker window.
This flag is not set by default. When it is not set, the Search Picker window will not show any panel or button related to the Saved Searches workflow. The flag [OpenLeftSidePanel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Search.SearchViewFlags.OpenLeftSidePanel.html) will not work without [EnableSearchQuery](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Search.SearchViewFlags.EnableSearchQuery.html).
