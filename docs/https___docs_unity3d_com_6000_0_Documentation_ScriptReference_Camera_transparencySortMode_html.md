[TransparencySortMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TransparencySortMode.html) transparencySortMode; 
### Description
Transparent object sorting mode.
By default, perspective Cameras sort objects based on distance from Camera position to the object center; and orthographic Cameras sort based on distance along the view direction.  
  
If you're making a 2D game with a perspective Camera, you might want to use [TransparencySortMode.Orthographic](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TransparencySortMode.Orthographic.html) sort mode so that objects are sorted based on distance along the Camera's view.  
  
Additional resources: [TransparencySortMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TransparencySortMode.html) enum, [opaqueSortMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-opaqueSortMode.html).
