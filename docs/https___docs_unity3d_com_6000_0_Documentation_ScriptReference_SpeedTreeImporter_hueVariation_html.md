[Color](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color.html) hueVariation; 
### Description
Gets and sets a default hue variation color and amount (in alpha).
The color of each tree varies based on its world space position and this hue variation color. Hue variation breaks up a large forest of trees and makes it look more natural. To enable hue variation, see [SpeedTreeImporter.enableHueByDefault](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpeedTreeImporter-enableHueByDefault.html).
