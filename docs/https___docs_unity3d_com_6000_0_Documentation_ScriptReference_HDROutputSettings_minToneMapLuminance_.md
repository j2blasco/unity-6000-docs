### Description
Minimum input luminance at which gradation is identifiable.
Measured in nits. This value is -1 if Unity cannot obtain a value from the HDR display. Accessing this member results in an exception if HDR is not available on the display. Use [HDROutputSettings.available](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/HDROutputSettings-available.html) for the display to check that HDR is available.
