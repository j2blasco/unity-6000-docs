Epsilon; 
### Description
A tiny floating point value (Read Only).
The smallest value that a float can have different from zero.  
  
With the following rules: 
  * anyValue + Epsilon = anyValue
  * anyValue - Epsilon = anyValue
  * 0 + Epsilon = Epsilon
  * 0 - Epsilon = -Epsilon


A value Between any number and Epsilon will result in an arbitrary number due to truncating errors.

    // to create a function to compare them.
