## Declaration
public static bool HasProLicense(); 
### Description
This has the same functionality as [Application.HasProLicense](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application.HasProLicense.html). At the moment, the Device Simulator doesn't support simulation of this method.
