# Paint tiles with the Paint tool
Use the **Paint** tool to select tiles and then paint them onto the **tilemap** A GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid overlay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tilemaps/work-with-tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Tilemap).
  1. Select the **Paint** tool from the **toolbar** A row of buttons and basic controls at the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in various ways (e.g. scaling, translation). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Toolbar.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Toolbar), or press its shortcut key **B**.

  2. Select a tile from the **Tile Palette** window and paint it onto the tilemap in the ****Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene)** view with the **Paint** tool. To paint with more than one tile, hold and drag the **Paint** tool over multiple tiles to select them all, then paint with them.
  3. To select tiles that are on the tilemap instead of the **Tile Palette** window, hold **Ctrl** to temporarily switch to the [Pick tool](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tilemaps/tile-palettes/tools/create-brush-picks-from-tiles-pick-tool.html) and pick tiles on the tilemap. After selecting the tile(s), release **Ctrl** to return to the **Paint** tool and paint with the selected tiles.
  4. To erase tiles, hold **Shift** to temporarily switch to the [Eraser tool](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tilemaps/tile-palettes/tools/remove-tiles-with-eraser-tool.html) and select tiles on the tilemap that you want to remove. Release **Shift** to return to the **Paint** tool.
