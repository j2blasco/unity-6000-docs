### Description
Add this function to a subclass to get a notification when a SpeedTree asset has completed importing.
This function behaves much like [OnPostprocessModel](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessModel.html) where modifications are allowed on the final imported Prefab before being saved on the disk.
