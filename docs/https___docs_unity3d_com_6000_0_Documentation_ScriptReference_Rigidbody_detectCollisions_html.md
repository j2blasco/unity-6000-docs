detectCollisions; 
### Description
Should collision detection be enabled? (By default always enabled).
Disabling collision detections is useful when you have a ragdoll which is setup to be kinematic and you want to avoid heavy collision detection calculations on that rigidbody. `detectCollisions` is not serialized. This means it doesn't show up in the Inspector and when Instantiating the rigidbody or saving it in a Scene, it will not be saved.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) rb;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)>();
    }  
  
    // Let the rigidbody take control and detect collisions.
    void EnableRagdoll()
    {
        rb.isKinematic = false;
        rb.detectCollisions = true;
    }  
  
    // Let animation control the rigidbody and ignore collisions.
    void DisableRagdoll()
    {
        rb.isKinematic = true;
        rb.detectCollisions = false;
    }
}

```
