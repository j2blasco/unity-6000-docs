## Declaration
public static Collider[] OverlapSphere([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) position, float radius, int layerMask = AllLayers, [QueryTriggerInteraction](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QueryTriggerInteraction.html) queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
position | Center of the sphere.  
radius | Radius of the sphere.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Layers.html) defines which layers of colliders to include in the query.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
### Returns
**Collider[]** Returns an array with all colliders touching or inside the sphere. 
### Description
Computes and stores colliders touching or inside the sphere.

Consider using [Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc.html) instead.

        foreach (var hitCollider in hitColliders)
