# UI Builder
UI Builder lets you visually create and edit UI assets, such as UI Documents (`.uxml`), and StyleSheets (`.uss`), that you use with [UI Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UIElements.html).
You can also install the following optional packages that offer additional functionality in UI Builder:
  * The `com.unity.vectorgraphics` package allows you to assign a `VectorImage` as a background style on an element.
  * The `com.unity.2d.sprite` package allows you to assign a 2D **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) asset (or sub-asset) as a background style on an element. With the 2D Sprite package installed, you can also open the 2D Sprite Editor directly from the ****Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector)** pane.
