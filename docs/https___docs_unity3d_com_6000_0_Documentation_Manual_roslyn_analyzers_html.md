# Roslyn analyzers and source generators
Use Roslyn analyzers, source generators and ruleset files in Unity projects to inspect your code for style, quality, and other issues.
You can use existing analyzer libraries to inspect your code, and write your own analyzers to promote the best practices or conventions within your organization.
**Note** : Roslyn analyzers are only compatible with the IDEs that Unity publicly supports, which are Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider.
For more information about how to write and use Roslyn analyzers, refer to Microsoftâ€™s [Analyzer Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/use-roslyn-analyzers?view=vs-2019) and [Get started with Roslyn analyzers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/getting-started-with-roslyn-analyzers?view=vs-2019) documentation.
