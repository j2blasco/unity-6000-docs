### Description
Instance ID of the [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) that was hit.
Provides a reference to the collider that was hit in a way that is accessible from jobs. For more information on creating jobs see [Create Jobs](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/JobSystemCreatingJobs.html).
