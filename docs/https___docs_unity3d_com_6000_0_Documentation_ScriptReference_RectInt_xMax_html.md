xMax; 
### Description
Shows the maximum X value of the `RectInt`.
Sets the maximum X value of [RectInt](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectInt.html). If you enter a maximum value that is less than the current minimum value, then the entered value becomes the new minimum value and the previous minimum value becomes the new maximum value. The position and size of the [RectInt](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectInt.html) is then adjusted based on the new minimum and maximum values.
