### Description
Specifies the source for the texture's red color channel data.
By default, values for the imported texture's red channel come from the source image's red channel. To reorder or invert color channels at import time, change this to another value of [TextureImporterSwizzle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporterSwizzle.html).
