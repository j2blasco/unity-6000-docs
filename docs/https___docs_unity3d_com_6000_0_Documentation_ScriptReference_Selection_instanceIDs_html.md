### Description
The actual unfiltered selection from the Scene returned as instance ids instead of [objects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Selection-objects.html).
All objects will be returned, including assets in projects. You can also assign objects to the selection.  
  
The instance ID of an object is always guaranteed to be unique.
