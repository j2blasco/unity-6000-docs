### Description
Represents a 128-bit hash value.
Use `Hash128` to uniquely identify a piece of data. A 128-bit hash value has an extremely low probability of hash collisions, so you can assume that if the hash values of two pieces of data are identical, then the data is identical too. For example, to quickly determine whether texture pixel contents have changed, or if they are identical between several textures, you can use [Texture.imageContentsHash](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture-imageContentsHash.html).  
  
To compute the hash values for some data, use the [Hash128.Compute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Hash128.Compute.html) function. To compute the hash values incrementally for several pieces of data, use [Hash128.Append](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Hash128.Append.html).
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        var hash = new Hash128[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Hash128.html)();
        hash.Append(42);
        hash.Append(13.0f);
        hash.Append("Hello");
        hash.Append(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5});
        // prints "2d6e582c3fcfb4b8f3c16650a75dc37b"
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)(hash.ToString());
    }
}

```

The hash algorithm used to compute `Hash128` values is [SpookyHash V2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_hash_function#SpookyHash). Note that while this hash algorithm is quite fast to compute and has good hash distribution qualities, it is not a cryptographic hash function.
