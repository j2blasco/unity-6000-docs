public static [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) Slerp([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) a, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) b, float t); 
### Description
Spherically interpolates between two vectors.
Interpolates between `a` and `b` by amount `t`. The difference between this and linear interpolation (aka, "lerp") is that the vectors are treated as directions rather than points in space. The direction of the returned vector is interpolated by the angle and its [magnitude](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-magnitude.html) is interpolated between the magnitudes of `from` and `to`.  
  
The parameter `t` is clamped to the range [0, 1].
