[Color](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color.html) radiusHandleColor; 
### Description
Returns or specifies the color of the radius control handle.
This value is multiplied with the value of [Handles.color](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Handles-color.html) at the time [DrawHandle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/IMGUI.Controls.ArcHandle.DrawHandle.html) is called. If [Color.a](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color-a.html) is `0` then the radius handle is disabled. This property is [Color.clear](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Color-clear.html) by default.
