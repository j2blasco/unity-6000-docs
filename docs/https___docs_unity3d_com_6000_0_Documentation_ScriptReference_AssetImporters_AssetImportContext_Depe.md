## Declaration
public void DependsOnArtifact(string path); 
## Declaration
public void DependsOnArtifact(GUID guid); 
## Declaration
public void DependsOnArtifact([Experimental.ArtifactKey](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Experimental.ArtifactKey.html) key); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
path | The path of the Asset whose artifact should be the dependency. Note: Although the dependency is the artifact (import result) which is stored in the library folder, this parameter is the path to the Asset in the Assets folder, and _not_ a path to the artifact in the Library folder.  
guid | The guid of the artifact dependency.  
key | The artifact key of the artifact dependency.  
### Description
Setup artifact dependency to an asset.
An artifact dependency is a dependency where an Asset depends on the import result (known as an artifact) of another Asset. If you change an Asset that has been marked as a dependency, all Assets which depend on it will also get reimported (after the dependency has been imported).  
  
Note: If you specify an Asset as a dependency that doesn't exist or hasn't yet been imported, the dependency is still registered. It is registered as an un-imported Asset. When the Asset is later imported, all Assets which depend on it will also get reimported.
