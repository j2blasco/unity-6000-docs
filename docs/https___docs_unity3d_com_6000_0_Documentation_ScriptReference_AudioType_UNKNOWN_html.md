### Description
The audio file you want to stream has a file format that is unknown to Unity.
Use this audio type for files with an extension the other audio types donâ€™t cover. If the audio file has a different format to the AudioType you choose, Unity might not play the audio correctly. **Note** : Avoid audio types that are unknown to Unity because Unity might not support them.
