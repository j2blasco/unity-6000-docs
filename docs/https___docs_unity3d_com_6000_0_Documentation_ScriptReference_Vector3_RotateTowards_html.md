## Declaration
public static [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) RotateTowards([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) current, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) target, float maxRadiansDelta, float maxMagnitudeDelta); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
current | The vector being managed.  
target | The vector.  
maxRadiansDelta | The maximum angle in radians allowed for this rotation.  
maxMagnitudeDelta | The maximum allowed change in vector magnitude for this rotation.  
### Returns
**Vector3** The location that RotateTowards generates. 
### Description
Rotates a vector `current` towards `target`.
This function is similar to [MoveTowards](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.MoveTowards.html) except that the vector is treated as a direction rather than a position. The `current` vector will be rotated round toward the `target` direction by an angle of `maxRadiansDelta`, although it will land exactly on the target rather than overshoot. If the magnitudes of `current` and `target` are different, then the magnitude of the result will be linearly interpolated during the rotation. If a negative value is used for `maxRadiansDelta`, the vector will rotate away from `target/` until it is pointing in exactly the opposite direction, then stops.
