isPlaying; 
### Description
Returns whether the VideoPlayer is currently playing the content.
This variable returns `false` if the video is paused. If you call [VideoPlayer.Play](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.Play.html), it might not always set `isPlaying` to `true`. The [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) must successfully prepare the content before it starts to play. To prepare the content before you use [VideoPlayer.Play](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.Play.html), use [VideoPlayer.Prepare](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.Prepare.html).
