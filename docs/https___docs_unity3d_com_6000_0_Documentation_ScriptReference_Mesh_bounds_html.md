[Bounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Bounds.html) bounds; 
### Description
The bounding volume of the Mesh.
This is the axis-aligned bounding box of the mesh in its own space, so the bounds don't change if you change the Transform position, rotation or scale. The [Renderer.bounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Renderer-bounds.html) property is similar but returns the bounds in world space.

// Generates planar UV coordinates independent of mesh size
