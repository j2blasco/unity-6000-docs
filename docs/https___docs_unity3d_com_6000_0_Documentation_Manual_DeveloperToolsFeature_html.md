# Engineering feature set
The Engineering **feature set** A feature set is a collection of related packages that you can use to achieve specific results in the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in Unityâ€™s Package Manager. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Featureset) contains packages for integration of C# integrated development environments (IDE), unit testing, code coverage and performance analysis.
## Getting started
Unity supports the following IDEs: Visual Studio (Windows, macOS) and JetBrains Rider (Windows, macOS, Linux).
To choose which IDE to use with the Unity Editor, open the [Preferences](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Preferences.html) window, then go to **External Tools** > **External Script Editor**.
The Unity Test Framework (UTF) lets you test your code in both Edit mode and Play mode, and also on target platforms such as Standalone, Android, and iOS.
To access the Unity Test Framework (UTF) in the Unity Editor, go to **Window** > **General** > **Test Runner**.
The Profile Analyzer aggregates and visualizes frame and marker data from a set of Unity **Profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Profiler) frames to help you understand their behavior. You can use the Profile Analyzer to compare two sets of data side-by-side, which complements the single frame analysis already available in the Unity Profiler. 
To open the Profile Analyzer window, go to **Window** > **Analysis** > **Profile Analyzer**.
Use the Code Coverage package with the Test Runner to gather and present test coverage information. Run your tests with code coverage enabled to check which lines of code execute when the tests run, and whether the tests pass or fail.
To open the Code Coverage window in the Unity Editor, go to **Window** > **Analysis** > **Code Coverage**.
Use the Editor coroutines package to start the execution of [iterator methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/yield) within the Editor, similar to how Unity handles [coroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/coroutines.html) inside [MonoBehaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html) **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts) during runtime.
## Packages
The Engineering feature set contains the following packages:
  * [Visual Studio Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.ide.visualstudio.html)
  * [JetBrains Rider Integration](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.ide.rider.html)
  * [Test Framework](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.test-framework.html)The Test Framework package (formerly called the Test Runner) is a Unity tool that tests your code in both Edit mode and Play mode, and also on target platforms such as Standalone, Android, or iOS. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#TestFramework)
  * [Profile Analyzer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.performance.profile-analyzer.html)
  * [Code Coverage](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage.html)
  * [Editor coroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.editorcoroutines.html)
