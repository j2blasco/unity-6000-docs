[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) position; 
### Description
The position of the rigidbody.
[Rigidbody.position](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-position.html) allows you to get and set the position of a Rigidbody using the physics engine. If you change the position of a Rigidbody using [Rigidbody.position](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-position.html), the transform will be updated after the next physics simulation step. This is faster than updating the position using [Transform.position](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-position.html), as the latter will cause all attached Colliders to recalculate their positions relative to the Rigidbody.  
  
If you want to continuously move a rigidbody use [Rigidbody.MovePosition](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.MovePosition.html) instead, which takes interpolation into account.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        GetComponent<Rigidbody[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)>().position = Vector3.zero[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-zero.html);
    }
}
