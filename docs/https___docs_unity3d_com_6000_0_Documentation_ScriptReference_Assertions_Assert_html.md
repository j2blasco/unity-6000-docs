### Description
The Assert class contains assertion methods for setting invariants in the code.
All method calls will be conditionally included only in a development build, unless specified explicitly. See [BuildOptions.ForceEnableAssertions](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildOptions.ForceEnableAssertions.html). The inclusion of an assertion is controlled by the `UNITY_ASSERTIONS` define.  
  
Assert throws exceptions whenever an assertion fails.  
  
If a debugger is attached to the project (System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached is true), [AssertionException](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Assertions.AssertionException.html) is thrown to pause the execution and invoke the debugger.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Assertions;  
  
public class AssertionExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public int health;
    public GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) go;  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        // You expect the health never to be equal to zero
        Assert.AreNotEqual[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Assertions.Assert.AreNotEqual.html)(0, health);  
  
        // The referenced GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) should be always (in every frame) be active
        Assert.IsTrue[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Assertions.Assert.IsTrue.html)(go.activeInHierarchy);
    }
}
