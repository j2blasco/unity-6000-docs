[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) velocity; 
### Description
The current relative velocity of the Character (see notes).
This allows you to track how fast the character is actually walking, for example when it is stuck at a wall this value will be the zero vector.  
  
Note: The velocity returned is simply the difference in distance for the current timestep before and after a call to [CharacterController.Move](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CharacterController.Move.html) or [CharacterController.SimpleMove](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CharacterController.SimpleMove.html). The velocity is relative because it won't track movements to the transform that happen outside of the CharacterController (e.g. character parented under another moving Transform, such as a moving vehicle).
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    CharacterController[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CharacterController.html) controller;
    void Start()
    {
        controller = GetComponent<CharacterController[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/CharacterController.html)>();
    }  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) horizontalVelocity = controller.velocity;
        horizontalVelocity = new Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html)(controller.velocity.x, 0, controller.velocity.z);  
  
        // The speed on the x-z plane ignoring any speed
        float horizontalSpeed = horizontalVelocity.magnitude;
        // The speed from gravity or jumping
        float verticalSpeed  = controller.velocity.y;
        // The overall speed
        float overallSpeed = controller.velocity.magnitude;
    }
}
