Note that changing the quality level can be an expensive operation if the new level has different anti-aliasing setting. It's fine to change the level when applying in-game quality options, but if you want to dynamically adjust quality level at runtime, pass false to applyExpensiveChanges so that expensive changes are not always applied.  
  
When building a player quality levels that are not used for that platform are stripped. You should not expect a given quality setting to be at a given index. It's best to query the available quality settings and use the returned index.
