### Description
The Scenes to be included in the build.
If empty, the currently open Scene will be built. Paths are relative to the project folder, for example "Assets/MyLevels/MyScene.unity". If any scene is currently open and has unsaved changes, the editor will ask the user to save these changes before building - or save changes automatically, if [Application.isBatchMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-isBatchMode.html) is true. Additional resources: [EditorBuildSettings.scenes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorBuildSettings-scenes.html).
