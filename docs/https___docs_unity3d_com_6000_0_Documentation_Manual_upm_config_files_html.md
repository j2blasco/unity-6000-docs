Configure your network for Package Manager
# Configuration files
You can use a configuration file to store custom settings for the Package Manager.
For example, you can use configuration files to:
  * Override the location or size of the global cache.
  * Store your token information for each scoped registry that requires authentication.


Package Manager supports two configuration files: a global configuration file and a user configuration file. Both of these files use the [TOML](https://toml.io) format and they appear in different locations:
  * **Global** configuration files apply to all users on the same computer. For example, you can define additional [SSL certificate authorities](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-config-network.html#SSL) when setting up a proxy server for the entire computer.
  * **User** configuration files apply to a single user. For example, you can set up [authentication tokens](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-config-scoped.html) to use for custom package registry servers that you access with scoped registries. These tokens authenticate a specific user account.


## Global configuration file location
Package Manager uses a global configuration file named `upmconfig.toml`. This file isn’t automatically created when you install the Unity Hub or a Unity Editor. However, you can create the file in the following location if you need to customize your configuration:
**Environment** | **Location**  
---|---  
Windows |  `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Unity\config\upmconfig.toml` (for example, `C:\ProgramData\Unity\config\upmconfig.toml`)  
macOS and Linux | `/etc/upmconfig.toml`  
You can define a custom location that overrides the default location for your configuration file. To do this, create a `UPM_GLOBAL_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable and set its value to the absolute path of your configuration file, including the file name.
## User configuration file location
Package Manager uses a user configuration file named `.upmconfig.toml`. This file isn’t created when you install the Unity Hub or Editor, but you can create it in the following location if you need to customize your configuration:
**Environment** | **Location**  
---|---  
Windows (user account) |  `%USERPROFILE%\.upmconfig.toml` (for example, `C:\Users\myusername\.upmconfig.toml`)  
Windows ([system user account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/local-accounts#default-local-system-accounts)) |  `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Unity\config\ServiceAccounts\.upmconfig.toml` (for example, `C:\Users\Public\Unity\config\ServiceAccounts\.upmconfig.toml`)  
macOS and Linux |  `~/.upmconfig.toml` (for example, `/Users/myusername/.upmconfig.toml`)  
You can define a custom location that overrides the default location for your configuration file. To do this, create a `UPM_USER_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable and set its value to the absolute path of your configuration file, including the file name.
