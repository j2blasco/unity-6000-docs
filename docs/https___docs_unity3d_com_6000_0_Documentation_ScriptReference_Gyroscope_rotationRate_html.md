[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) rotationRate; 
### Description
Returns rotation rate as measured by the device's gyroscope.
The rotation rate is given as a Vector3 representing the speed of rotation around each of the three axes in radians per second. This is the value as it is reported by the gyroscope hardware - a more accurate measurement that has been processed to remove "bias" can be obtained with the [rotationRateUnbiased](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gyroscope-rotationRateUnbiased.html) property.
```

using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public float shakeSpeed;
    public AudioClip[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioClip.html) shakeSound;
    AudioSource[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioSource.html) audioSource;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioSource.html)>();
    }  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        if (Input.gyro.rotationRate.y > shakeSpeed && !audioSource.isPlaying)
            audioSource.PlayOneShot(shakeSound);
    }
