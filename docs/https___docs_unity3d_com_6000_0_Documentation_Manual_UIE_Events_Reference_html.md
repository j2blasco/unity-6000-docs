Capture events
# Event reference
UI Toolkit raises an event when a user interacts with and changes the state of elements from UI Toolkit. The event design is similar to the [Event interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) for HTML elements.
Event types fit into a hierarchy based on the [EventBase](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.EventBase.html) class. Each event family implements an interface that defines the common characteristics of all events of the same family. For example, `BlurEvent` and `FocusEvent` use the [FocusEventBase](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.FocusEventBase_1.html) class.
Select any of the event types listed below for more information on the event, its parent class, and links to the API documentation.
