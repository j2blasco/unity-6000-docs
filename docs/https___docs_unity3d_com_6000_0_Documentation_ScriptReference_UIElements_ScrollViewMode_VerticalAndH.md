### Description
Configure [ScrollView](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.ScrollView.html) for vertical and horizontal scrolling. 
Requires elements with the height property explicitly defined. A ScrollView configured with this mode has the [ScrollView.verticalHorizontalVariantUssClassName](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.ScrollView-verticalHorizontalVariantUssClassName.html) class in its class list. The difference with the vertical mode is that content will not wrap.
