maxSubTextureSize; 
### Description
Specifies the maximum size (width/height) of a texture that can be added to the atlas. When activeFilters contains [DynamicAtlasFilters.Size](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.DynamicAtlasFilters.Size.html), textures larger than this size are excluded from the atlas. Otherwise, this value is not used.
