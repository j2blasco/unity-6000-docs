Introduction to asynchronous programming with Awaitable
# Asynchronous programming with the Awaitable class
Asynchronous programming allows your code to perform long-running tasks without blocking the main thread. This allows your application to remain responsive and perform other tasks while it waits for an asynchronous task to complete.
Unity supports a simplified asynchronous programming model using the .NET [async](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/async) key word and [await](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/await) operator. 
Before reading about asynchronous programming in Unity, make sure you understand the fundamental elements of asynchronous programming in .NET. For important context, refer to [Asynchronous programming with async and await](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/) and [Task asynchronous programming model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/task-asynchronous-programming-model). 
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to Awaitable](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/async-awaitable-introduction.html) | Understand the key features of Unityâ€™s `Awaitable` and how it compares to both .NET `Task` and iterator-based coroutines.  
[Awaitable completion and continuation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/async-awaitable-continuations.html) | Understand how asynchronous code resumes on completion of an awaited task and how this affects the function and performance of your application.  
[Awaitable code example reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/async-awaitable-examples.html) | Solve common asynchronous programming problems with a reference of `Awaitable` code examples.
