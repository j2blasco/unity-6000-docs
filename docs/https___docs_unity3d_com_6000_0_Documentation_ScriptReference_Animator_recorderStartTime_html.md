recorderStartTime; 
### Description
Start time of the first frame of the buffer relative to the frame at which [StartRecording](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animator.StartRecording.html) was called.
For example, if we started recording at frame 10, and the buffer is 5 frames long. If the buffer is not initialized ([StartRecording](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animator.StartRecording.html) is not called), the value of this property will be -1.
