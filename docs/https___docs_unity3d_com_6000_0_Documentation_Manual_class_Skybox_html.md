# Sky
Resources for adding sky to the background of your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) using a **skybox** material and **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader).

[Introduction to sky](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sky.html) | Learn about skybox materials, and how the sky solution choose depends on which **render pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) your project uses.  
[Create a skybox](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/skyboxes-using.html) | Create a skybox material, and draw the sky for all your cameras, or a specific **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Camera).  
[Configure a skybox with a Skybox Shader](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/skybox-shaders.html) | Use shaders with different set of properties and sky generation techniques.  
[Skybox Shader Material Inspector window reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/skybox-material-reference.html) | Explore the properties of the Skybox Shader Material **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector) windows.

  * [Cubemaps](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Cubemap-landing.html)A collection of six square textures that can represent the reflections in an environment or the skybox drawn behind your geometry. The six squares form the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object; each face represents the view along the directions of the world axes (up, down, left, right, forward and back).
