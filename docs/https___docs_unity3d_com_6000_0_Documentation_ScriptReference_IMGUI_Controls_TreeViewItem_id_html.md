### Description
Unique ID for an item.
This ID needs to be unique among all TreeViewItems and is used to identify a TreeViewItem.  
  
If the tree is representing objects derived from UnityEngine.Object, it is a good idea to use the ID returned from GetInstanceID() for each object as the ID, as these are guaranteed to be unique.
