Customize movement constraint with Configurable Joints
# Create a configurable joint
To create a custom configurable **joint** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#joint) and have fine control over behavior, you can use the [Configurable Joint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ConfigurableJoint.html)An extremely customizable joint that other joint types are derived from. It can be used to create anything from adapted versions of existing joints to custom designed and highly specialized joints. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ConfigurableJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#ConfigurableJoint). You can also use the Configurable Joint to implement physics forces that drive a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) to a specific **target velocity** A joint property to set the desired velocity with which the joint should move to the Target Position under the drive force. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ConfigurableJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#TargetVelocity) or position. 
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Customize movement constraint with Configurable Joints](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/configurable-joints-movement-constraint.html) | Use a custom joint to add limits to a GameObject’s movement or rotation, and configure how bouncy or elastic that limit is.  
[Driving forces with Configurable Joints](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/configurable-joints-driving-forces.html) | Use a custom joint to define the driving linear and rotational forces on a GameObject.  
[Configure driving forces on a Configurable Joint](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/configure-driving-forces.html) | Use the Configurable Joint to create custom targets and driving forces.  
[Configurable Joint component reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ConfigurableJoint.html) | Property reference for the Configurable Joint component.  
Because the Configurable Joint has a lot of configuration options, you might need to experiment and iterate with values to get the joint to behave exactly the way you want.
