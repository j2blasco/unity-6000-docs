### Description
OnMouseUpAsButton is only called when the mouse is released over the same [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) as it was pressed.
Additional resources: [OnMouseUp](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseUp.html).

This function is not called on objects that belong to Ignore Raycast layer.  
  
This function is called on Colliders and 2D Colliders marked as trigger when the following properties are set to true:   
  
- For 3D physics: [Physics.queriesHitTriggers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics-queriesHitTriggers.html)  
  
- For 2D physics: [Physics2D.queriesHitTriggers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics2D-queriesHitTriggers.html)   
  
[OnMouseUpAsButton](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseUpAsButton.html) can be a co-routine, simply use the yield statement in the function. This event is sent to all scripts attached to the [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html).
