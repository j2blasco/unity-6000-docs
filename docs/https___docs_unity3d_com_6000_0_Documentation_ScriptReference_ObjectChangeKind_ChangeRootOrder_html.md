### Description
A change of this type indicates that a GameObject placed at the scene root has been reordered in the hierarchy. This happens when [Undo.SetSiblingIndex](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.SetSiblingIndex.html) is called or when reordering such a GameObject in the hierarchy under the same scene.
