## Declaration
public void Render(); 
### Description
Render the camera manually.
This will render the camera. It will use the camera's clear flags, target texture and all other settings.  
  
The camera will send [OnPreCull](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnPreCull.html), [OnPreRender](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnPreRender.html) and [OnPostRender](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnPostRender.html) to any scripts attached, and render any eventual image filters.  
  
This is used for taking precise control of render order. To make use of this feature, create a camera and disable it. Then call Render on it.  
  
You are not able to call the Render function from a camera that is currently rendering. If you wish to do this create a copy of the camera, and make it match the original one using [CopyFrom](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.CopyFrom.html).
