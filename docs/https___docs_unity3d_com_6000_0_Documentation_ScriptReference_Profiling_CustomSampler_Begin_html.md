### Description
Begin profiling a piece of code with a custom label defined by this instance of [CustomSampler](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.CustomSampler.html).
This will show up in the Profiler hierarchy.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    CustomSampler[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.CustomSampler.html) sampler;
    void Start()
    {
        sampler = CustomSampler.Create[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.CustomSampler.Create.html)("MyCustomSampler");
    }  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        sampler.Begin();
        // do something that takes a lot of time
        sampler.End();
    }
}

```

Profiler.BeginSample is conditionally compiled away using ConditionalAttribute. Thus it will have zero overhead, when it is deployed in non-Development Build.
