### Description
This event is called for every item added to the [itemsSource](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.BaseListView-itemsSource.html). Includes the item index. 
Note: This event is only called when items are added through the [viewController](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.BaseListView-viewController.html), such as when calling [AddItems](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.BaseListView.AddItems.html). Adding items directly to the [itemsSource](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.BaseListView-itemsSource.html) will not trigger this event.
