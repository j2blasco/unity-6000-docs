### Description
The DPI that the UI is designed for. 
When [PanelSettings.scaleMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.PanelSettings-scaleMode.html) is set to `ConstantPhysicalSize`, Unity compares this value to the actual screen DPI, and scales the UI accordingly in the Game view.  
  
If Unity cannot determine the screen DPI, it uses the [PanelSettings.fallbackDpi](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.PanelSettings-fallbackDpi.html) instead.
