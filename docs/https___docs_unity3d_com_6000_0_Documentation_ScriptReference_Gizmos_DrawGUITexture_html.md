## Declaration
public static void DrawGUITexture([Rect](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html) screenRect, [Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.html) texture, [Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html) mat = null); 
## Declaration
public static void DrawGUITexture([Rect](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html) screenRect, [Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.html) texture, int leftBorder, int rightBorder, int topBorder, int bottomBorder, [Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Material.html) mat = null); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
screenRect | The size and position of the texture on the "screen" defined by the XY plane.  
texture | The texture to be displayed.  
mat | An optional material to apply the texture.  
leftBorder | Inset from the rectangle's left edge.  
rightBorder | Inset from the rectangle's right edge.  
topBorder | Inset from the rectangle's top edge.  
bottomBorder | Inset from the rectangle's bottom edge.  
### Description
Draw a texture in the Scene.
The chosen texture is drawn in 3D space on a "screen" defined by the XY plane (ie, the plane where the Z coordinate is zero). The values of the texture rectangle are given in Scene units. The optional border values specify an inset from each edge within the rectangle in Scene units; the texture is drawn inside the inset rectangle and the edge pixels are repeated outwards. This is a useful quick way to create a large background region around the main texture when its edges are of a single colour.  
  
This function can be useful for creating GUI backgrounds in conjunction with a camera pointing directly at the texture.
