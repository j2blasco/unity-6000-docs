### Description
Render texture color pixels are memoryless when [RenderTexture.antiAliasing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-antiAliasing.html) is set to 1.
Note that memoryless render textures are only supported on iOS/tvOS 10.0+ Metal and Vulkan. Render textures are read/write protected and stored in CPU or GPU memory on other platforms.
