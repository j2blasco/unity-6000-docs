fullScreen; 
### Description
Enables full-screen mode for the application.
Use this property to toggle full-screen mode:
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Toggle[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.Toggle.html) fullscreen
        Screen.fullScreen[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Screen-fullScreen.html) = !Screen.fullScreen[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Screen-fullScreen.html);
    }
}

```

A full-screen switch does not happen immediately; it happens when the current frame is finished.  
  
**Notes:**
  * `Screen.fullScreen` is read-only on iOS.
  * When Stage Manager is enabled on iPadOS, the `Screen.fullScreen` remains true for the application built with [full screen display mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsiOS.html#Multitasking). The application maintains the full screen resolution in supported orientations even when the Stage Manager scales the application.
