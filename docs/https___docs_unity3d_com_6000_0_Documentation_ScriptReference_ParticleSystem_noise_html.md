[ParticleSystem.NoiseModule](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.NoiseModule.html) noise; 
### Description
Script interface for the NoiseModule of a Particle System.
The Noise Module allows you to apply turbulence to the movement of your particles. Use the low quality settings to create computationally efficient Noise, or simulate smoother, richer Noise with the higher quality settings. You can also choose to define the behavior of the Noise individually for each axis.  
  
Particle System modules do not need to be reassigned back to the system; they are interfaces and not independent objects.
