### Description
The name of the function that will be called.
This is the same as calling gameObject.SendMessage(animationEvent.functionName, animationEvent). The function called can have zero or a single argument. See the script example at [AnimationEvent](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationEvent.html) to see how `functionName` can be used.
