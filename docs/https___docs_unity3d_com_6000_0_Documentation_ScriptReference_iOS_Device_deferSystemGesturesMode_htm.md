[iOS.SystemGestureDeferMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/iOS.SystemGestureDeferMode.html) deferSystemGesturesMode; 
### Description
Defer system gestures until the second swipe on specific edges.
Select one or more edges that users must swipe twice to enact system gestures.  
  
On iOS devices, users can perform actions by swiping from different edges of the screen. For example, you can naviagte home by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. This can cause issues with games that use swiping for interaction.   
  
Use `deferSystemGesturesMode` to control which screen edge gestures the system waits for before responding to the second swipe. The first swipe is ignored to help prevent unintentional actions in the app. The iOS Human Interface Guidelines do not recommend turning on this setting, as it could confuse users.  
  
**Note** : The initial value of this setting is defined by the [PlayerSettings.iOS.deferSystemGesturesMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings.iOS-deferSystemGesturesMode.html) property.
