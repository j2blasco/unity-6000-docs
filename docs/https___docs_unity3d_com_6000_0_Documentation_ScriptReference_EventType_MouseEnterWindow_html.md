### Description
Mouse entered a window (Editor views only).
The user hovered the mouse over a window without any buttons being held down. This event is sent once, as the mouse enters the window.  
  
Note that this event is only sent in the Editor for [EditorWindow](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorWindow.html) windows which have [EditorWindow.wantsMouseEnterLeaveWindow](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorWindow-wantsMouseEnterLeaveWindow.html) set to true. Mouse enter or leave window events are never sent in the games.
