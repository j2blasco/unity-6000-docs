## Declaration
public [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) GetPointVelocity([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) worldPoint); 
### Description
The velocity of the rigidbody at the point `worldPoint` in global space.
GetPointVelocity will take the angularVelocity of the rigidbody into account when calculating the velocity.
