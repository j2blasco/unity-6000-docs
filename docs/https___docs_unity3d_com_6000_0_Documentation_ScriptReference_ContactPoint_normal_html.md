[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) normal; 
### Description
Normal of the contact point.
The following example will draw a line to represent every normal from a collision. Each line will be drawn in the Scene view.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void OnCollisionEnter(Collision[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html) other)
    {
        // Print how many points are colliding with this transform
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Points colliding: " + other.contacts.Length);  
  
        // Print the normal of the first point in the collision.
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("Normal of the first point: " + other.contacts[0].normal);  
  
        // Draw a different colored ray for every normal in the collision
        foreach (var item in other.contacts)
        {
            Debug.DrawRay[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.DrawRay.html)(item.point, item.normal * 100, Random.ColorHSV[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Random.ColorHSV.html)(0f, 1f, 1f, 1f, 0.5f, 1f), 10f);
