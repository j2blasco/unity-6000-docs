## Declaration
public int GetDriveTargetVelocities(List<float> targetVelocities); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
targetVelocities | Supplied list of floats to read back and store the joint drive target velocities data.   
### Returns
**int** Total degrees of freedom for the entire hierarchy of articulation bodies. 
### Description
Reads back articulation body joint drive target velocities of the entire hierarchy to the supplied list of floats .
This returns joint drive target velocities in the reduced coordinate space for the entire articulation hierarchy starting from root to the supplied list of floats. Every joint target velocity DOF is represented by one float value, however depending on the type of the articulation joint there might be zero, one or 3 DOFs per joint. The exact location of the data in resulting list for the specific articulation body can be found by calling [ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices.html) and indexing returned dofStartIndices list by the particular body index via [ArticulationBody.index](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody-index.html). Number of degrees of freedom for the articulation body can be found using [ArticulationBody.dofCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody-dofCount.html).  
  
Units of measurement - m/s (meters per second) for linear and rad/s (radians per second) for angular motion.
