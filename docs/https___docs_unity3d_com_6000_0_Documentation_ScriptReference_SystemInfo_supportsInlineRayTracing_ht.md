### Description
Is inline ray tracing (ray query) supported? (Read Only)
Inline ray tracing is an alternative form of ray tracing available in compute shaders and rasterization stages through the `RayQuery` HLSL object. In DirectX 12 (DX12), this property corresponds to DirectX Raytracing (DXR) Tier 1.1 support.  
  
The `RayQuery` object is defined in HLSL when you use the DirectX 12 and DirectX Shader Compiler (DXC). Other shader compilers that different platforms use either donâ€™t define the `RayQuery` object or its name is different. Because of this, the recommended approach is to include the `UnityRayQuery.cginc` header and use the `UnityRayQuery` object instead of `RayQuery`.
