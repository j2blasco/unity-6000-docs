### Description
The stencil buffer bound for rendering may also bound as a samplable texture to the graphics pipeline: some platforms require the stencil buffer to be set to read-only mode in such cases (D3D11, Vulkan). This flag can be used for both packed depth-stencil as well as separate depth-stencil formats.
