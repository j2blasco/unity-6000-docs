isPrimary; 
### Description
Gets a boolean value that indicates whether the pointer is a primary pointer. True means the pointer is a primary pointer. False means it isn't. 
A primary pointer is a pointer that manipulates the mouse cursor. The mouse pointer is always a primary pointer. For touch events, the first finger that touches the screen is the primary pointer. Once it is processed, a pointer event from a primary pointer generates compatibility mouse events.
