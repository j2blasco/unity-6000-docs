[ParticleSystem.CollisionModule](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.CollisionModule.html) collision; 
### Description
Script interface for the CollisionModule of a Particle System.
This module allows particles to collide with a predefined list of planes, or with the 2D and 3D physics worlds.  
  
Particle System modules do not need to be reassigned back to the system; they are interfaces and not independent objects.
