bounceIntensity; 
### Description
The multiplier that defines the strength of the bounce lighting.
0 means no bounce light (only direct lighting) will be produced. 1 is physically correct behaviour and the default. The intensity of indirect lighting scales the same with the intensity of the light. A value larger than 1 means an artificially high amount of bounce light will be emitted.
