### Description
Indicates that [TextureMipmapLimitSettings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureMipmapLimitSettings.html) overrides the global texture mipmap limit by the [TextureMipmapLimitSettings.limitBias](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureMipmapLimitSettings-limitBias.html) value, instead of offsetting it.
Additional resources: [TextureMipmapLimitSettings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureMipmapLimitSettings.html), [TextureMipmapLimitSettings.limitBiasMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureMipmapLimitSettings-limitBiasMode.html).
