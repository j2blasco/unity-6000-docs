[Rect](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html) layout; 
### Description
The position and size of the VisualElement relative to its parent, as computed by the layout system. (Read Only) 
Before reading from this property, add it to a panel and wait for one frame to ensure that the element layout is computed. After the layout is computed, a [GeometryChangedEvent](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.GeometryChangedEvent.html) will be sent on this element.
