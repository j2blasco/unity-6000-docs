### Description
Volume extent of a 3D render texture or number of slices of array texture.
For volumetric render textures (see [dimension](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-dimension.html)), this variable determines the volume extent.  
  
For array render texture (see [dimension](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-dimension.html)), this variable determines the number of slices.
