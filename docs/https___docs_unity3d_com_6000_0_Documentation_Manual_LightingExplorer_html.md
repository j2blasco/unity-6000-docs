# Light Explorer window
The Light Explorer window allows you to select and edit light sources. To open the **Light Explorer** window from the menu, navigate to **Window** > **Rendering** > **Light Explorer**. 
Use the five tabs at the top of the panel to view settings for the [lights](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-Light.html), [2D lights](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/Lights-2D-intro.html), [Reflection Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ReflectionProbe.html)A rendering component that captures a spherical view of its surroundings in all directions, rather like a camera. The captured image is then stored as a Cubemap that can be used by objects with reflective materials. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ReflectionProbe.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#ReflectionProbe), [light probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightProbes.html)Light probes store information about how light passes through space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged within a given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery within that space. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightProbes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#LightProbe), and static emissive materials in the current **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene). The editable parameters are the most commonly-used fields for each component type.
To avoid having to scroll the window a lot when you have many lights in a scene, select the lights you want to work on, then select **Isolate Selection**. Unity removes the other lights from the window until you disable **Isolate Selection** again.
