### Description
This function is called when the behaviour becomes disabled.
This is also called when the object is destroyed and can be used for any cleanup code. When scripts are reloaded after compilation has finished, OnDisable will be called, followed by an OnEnable after the script has been loaded.
```
// Implement OnDisable and OnEnable script functions.
// These functions will be called when the attached GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html)
// is toggled.
// This example also supports the Editor[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.html).  The Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html) function
// will be called, for example, when the position of the
// GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) is changed.
