### Description
Is this renderer visible in any camera? (Read Only)
Note that the object is considered visible when it needs to be rendered in the Scene. For example, it might not actually be visible by any camera but still need to be rendered for shadows. When running in the editor, the Scene view cameras will also cause this value to be true.
