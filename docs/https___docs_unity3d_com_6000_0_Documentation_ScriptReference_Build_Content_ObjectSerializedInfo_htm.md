### Description
Struct containing details about how an object was serialized.
Note: this struct and its members exist to provide low-level support for the **Scriptable Build Pipeline** package. This is intended for internal use only; use the [Scriptable Build Pipeline package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.scriptablebuildpipeline@latest/index.html) to implement a fully featured build pipeline. You can install this via the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@latest/index.html).
