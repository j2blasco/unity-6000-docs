### Description
Additional texture coordinate.
UVs usually use [Vector2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html) format. Vector2 uses two 32-bit floats; 8 bytes in total.  
  
This vertex attribute maps to the `TEXCOORD1` semantic in HLSL. This UV channel is also commonly called "UV1". It corresponds to [Mesh.uv2](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh-uv2.html).
