### Description
A Collection such as List, HashSet, Dictionary etc can be pooled and reused by using a CollectionPool.
Note the CollectionPool is not thread-safe. Additional resources: [DictionaryPool<T0,T1>](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.DictionaryPool_2.html), [HashSetPool<T0>](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.HashSetPool_1.html), [ListPool<T0>](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.ListPool_1.html).
```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Pool;  
  
// This example shows how both version of Get could be used to simplify a line of points.
public class Simplify2DLine
{
    public List<Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)> SimplifyLine(Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)[] points)
    {
        // This version will only be returned to the pool if we call Release on it.
        var simplifiedPoints = CollectionPool<List<Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)>, Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)>.Get();  
  
        // Copy the points into a temp list so we can pass them into the Simplify method
        // When the pooled object leaves the scope it will be Disposed and returned to the pool automatically.
        // This version is ideal for working with temporary lists.
