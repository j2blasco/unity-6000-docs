### Description
Mixed lights allow a mix of real-time and baked lighting, based on the Mixed Lighting Mode used. These lights cannot move, but can change color and intensity at run time. Changes to color and intensity only affect direct lighting as indirect lighting gets baked. If using Subtractive mode, changes to color or intensity are not calculated at run time on static objects.
