mipmapLimitGroupName; 
### Description
Name of the texture mipmap limit group to which this texture belongs.
Has no effect if the [textureShape](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporter-textureShape.html) is not `Texture2D` or `Texture2DArray`. Also, has no effect on textures without mipmaps. For additional information, see [Texture2D.mipmapLimitGroup](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D-mipmapLimitGroup.html) and [Texture2DArray.mipmapLimitGroup](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2DArray-mipmapLimitGroup.html).
