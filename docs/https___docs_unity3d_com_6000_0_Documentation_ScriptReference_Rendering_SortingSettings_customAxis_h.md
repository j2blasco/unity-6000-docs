[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) customAxis; 
### Description
Used to calculate distance to objects, by comparing the positions of objects to this axis.
When the sorting mode is set to Custom Axis, use this together with [worldToCameraMatrix](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.SortingSettings-worldToCameraMatrix.html) and [cameraPosition](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.SortingSettings-cameraPosition.html) to determine the distances to objects for sorting.
