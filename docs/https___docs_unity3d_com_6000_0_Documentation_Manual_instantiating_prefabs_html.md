Introduction to instantiating prefabs
# Instantiating prefabs at runtime
[Prefabs](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Prefabs.html)An asset type that allows you to store a GameObject complete with components and properties. The prefab acts as a template from which you can create new object instances in the scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Prefabs.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Prefab) are useful when you want to instantiate complicated **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) or collections of GameObjects at runtime. Compared with creating GameObjects from scratch using code, instantiating prefabs using code has many advantages because you can:
  * Instantiate a prefab using one line of code. Creating equivalent GameObjects from scratch requires many more lines of code.
  * Set up, test, and modify the prefab quickly and easily using the ****Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) view**, **Hierarchy** , and ****Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector)** windows.
  * Change which prefab is instantiated without changing the code. You can make a simple rocket into a super-charged rocket, without any code changes.
