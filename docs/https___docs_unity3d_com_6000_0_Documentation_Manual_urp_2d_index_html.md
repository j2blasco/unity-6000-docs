# 2D lighting in URP
Techniques and resources for creating 2D lights and applying 2D lighting effects.
Topic | Description  
---|---  
[Types of 2D lights](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/LightTypes.html) | Discover the different properties and options available for each type of Light 2D and learn which is the best fit for your project.  
[Set up the 2D Renderer asset in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/Setup.html) | Install the following Editor and package versions to begin working with the 2D Renderer.  
[Prepare and upgrade sprites for 2D lighting in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/PrepShader.html) | Prepare your **sprites** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) and existing materials to be lit by 2D lighting.  
[Enable 2D lighting with the Tilemap Renderer in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tilemaps/work-with-tilemaps/tilemap-renderer-reference.html) | Set up the required settings to use the **Tilemap** A GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid overlay. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/tilemaps/work-with-tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Tilemap) Renderer component with URP to enable 2D lighting.  
[Blend Modes in 2D lighting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2d-light-blending.html) | Learn how different Blend Modes and masking affect how a sprite is lit.  
[Create shadows with Shadow Caster 2D in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2DShadows.html) | Learn how the Shadow Caster 2D component defines the shape and properties that a Light uses to determine its cast shadows.  
[Create a 2D sprite lit Shader Graph in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/ShaderGraph.html) | Create a **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) that reacts to 2D lights when applied to materials.  
[Light a VFX Graph asset with 2D lights in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2d-visual-effect-graph-compatibility.html) | Create a VFX Graph asset and then light it with a 2D light by using [Shader Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest).  
[Optimizing 2D lights](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2d-light-optimize.html) | Optimize 2D lighting in your project.  
[2D Renderer asset component reference for URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2DRendererData-overview.html) | Explore the properties and settings of the 2D Renderer Data Asset to customize the 2D lighting features.  
[Light Blend Styles component reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/LightBlendStyles.html) | Find the Light Blend Styles settings in the [2D Renderer Data asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2DRendererData-overview.html) to customize the way that the light interacts with sprites in the **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene).
