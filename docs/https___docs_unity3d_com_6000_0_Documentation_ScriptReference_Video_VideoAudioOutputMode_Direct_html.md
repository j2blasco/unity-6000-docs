### Description
Send the embedded audio direct to the platform's audio hardware.
The VideoPlayer bypasses Unity’s AudioSource and plays the video with its original audio directly to audio hardware (speakers, headphones etc.). Useful if you don’t want to alter the audio or you want to save resources.
