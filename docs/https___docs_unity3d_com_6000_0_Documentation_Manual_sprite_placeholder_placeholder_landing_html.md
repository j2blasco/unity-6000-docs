# Placeholder sprites
Use the the **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) Creator to create temporary placeholder **sprite** (2D) graphics. You can use these in your project during development and then replace them with the graphics you want to use.
**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[**Access the Sprite Creator**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/placeholder/access-sprite-creator.html) | Choose the placeholder shape in the Sprite Creator.  
[**Replace the placeholder sprite**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/placeholder/replace-placeholder-sprite.html) | Choose a new 2D graphic asset from the **Sprite Renderer** A component that lets you display images as Sprites for use in both 2D and 3D scenes. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/renderer/renderer-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#SpriteRenderer) Component in the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Inspector).  
[**Use the placeholder sprite**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/placeholder/use-placeholder-sprite.html) | Replace the placeholder sprite with the actual sprite.  
## Prerequisites
You must have the [2D Sprite package](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/placeholder/com.unity.2d.sprite.html) to have the different **Sprite** options in the **Assets** menu. This package is part of the [2D feature set](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/2DFeature.html) and are automatically installed if you select the **2D** project template when creating a new project.
## Details
  * The Sprite Creator makes 4x4 white PNG outline textures.
  * The placeholder sprites are perfect primitive polygons (e.g. triangle, hexagon, n-sided polygon), generated by algorithm.
