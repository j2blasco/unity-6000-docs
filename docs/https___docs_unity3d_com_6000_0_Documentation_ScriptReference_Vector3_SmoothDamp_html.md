public static [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) SmoothDamp([Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) current, [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) target, ref [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) currentVelocity, float smoothTime, float maxSpeed = Mathf.Infinity, float deltaTime = Time.deltaTime); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
current | The current position.  
target | The position we are trying to reach.  
currentVelocity | The current velocity, this value is modified by the function every time you call it.  
smoothTime | Approximately the time it will take to reach the target. A smaller value will reach the target faster.  
maxSpeed | Optionally allows you to clamp the maximum speed.  
deltaTime | The time since the last call to this function. By default Time.deltaTime.  
### Description
Gradually changes a vector towards a desired goal over time.
The vector is smoothed by some spring-damper like function, which will never overshoot. The most common use is for smoothing a follow camera.
```
// Smooth towards the target  
  
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Transform[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) target;
    public float smoothTime = 0.3F;
    private Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) velocity = Vector3.zero[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3-zero.html);  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        // Define a target position above and behind the target transform
        Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) targetPosition = target.TransformPoint(new Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html)(0, 5, -10));  
  
        // Smoothly move the camera towards that target position
        transform.position = Vector3.SmoothDamp[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.SmoothDamp.html)(transform.position, targetPosition, ref velocity, smoothTime);
    }
}
