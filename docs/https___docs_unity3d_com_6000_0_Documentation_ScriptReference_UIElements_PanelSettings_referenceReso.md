[Vector2Int](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2Int.html) referenceResolution; 
### Description
The resolution the UI is designed for. 
If the screen resolution is larger than the reference resolution, Unity scales the UI up in the Game view. If it's smaller, Unity scales the UI down. Unity scales the UI according to the [PanelSettings.screenMatchMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.PanelSettings-screenMatchMode.html).
