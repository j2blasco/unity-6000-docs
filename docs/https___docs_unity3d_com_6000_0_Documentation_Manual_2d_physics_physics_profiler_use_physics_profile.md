# Use the Physics Profiler Legacy mode
You can switch to the **Legacy** mode to see the older version of the Physics 2D **Profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Profiler) module, which was the default module in older versions of Unity. To do this, select **Legacy** from the dropdown menu at the upper-right of the Profiler moduleâ€™s details pane.
In this mode, you can load and inspect Profiler data that was saved in an older version of Unity. If you switch to this mode to inspect data captured in a newer version of Unity, then the data displayed may be unreliable and inaccurate. It is recommended to always use the **Current** mode to inspect Physics 2D Profiler data in current versions of Unity.
