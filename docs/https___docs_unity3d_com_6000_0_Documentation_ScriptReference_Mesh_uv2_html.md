uv2; 
### Description
The texture coordinates (UVs) in the second channel.
This channel is also commonly called "UV1". It maps to the shader semantic `TEXCOORD1`. When you call [Mesh.HasVertexAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.HasVertexAttribute.html), this channel corresponds to [VertexAttribute.TexCoord1](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.VertexAttribute.TexCoord1.html).  
  
Unity can use this channel to store UVs for baked lightmaps, or input UVs that it uses to calculte final UVs for real-time lightmaps. For more information, see [Lightmap UVs](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightingGiUvs.html).  
  
Unity stores UVs in 0-1 space. [0,0] represents the bottom-left corner of the texture, and [1,1] represents the top-right. Values are not clamped; you can use values below 0 and above 1 if needed.  
  
This property is supported for backwards compatibility, but the newer [GetUVs](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.GetUVs.html) and [SetUVs](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.SetUVs.html) functions allow you to access the same data in a more user-friendly way, and use a Vector3 or Vector4 value if you need to.  
  
This property returns a copy of the data. This means that it causes a heap memory allocation. It also means that to make changes to the original data, you must update the copy and then reassign the updated copy to the mesh.  
  
The following example demonstrates how to create an array to hold UV data, assign texture coordinates to it, and then assign it to the mesh.
```
// Generate planar uv coordinates for the second uv set  
  
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Mesh[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mesh.html) mesh = GetComponent<MeshFilter[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MeshFilter.html)>().mesh;
        Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html)[] vertices = mesh.vertices;
        Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)[] uvs = new Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)[vertices.Length];  
  
        for (int i = 0; i < uvs.Length; i++)
        {
            uvs[i] = new Vector2[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector2.html)(vertices[i].x, vertices[i].z);
        }
        mesh.uv2 = uvs;
    }
}

```
