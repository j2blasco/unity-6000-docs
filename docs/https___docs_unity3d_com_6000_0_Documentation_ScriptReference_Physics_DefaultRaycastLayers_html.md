### Description
Layer mask constant to select default raycast layers.
This can be used in the layermask field of [Physics.Raycast](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html) and other methods to select the default raycast layers. The default layers are all layers except for the ignore raycast layer.
