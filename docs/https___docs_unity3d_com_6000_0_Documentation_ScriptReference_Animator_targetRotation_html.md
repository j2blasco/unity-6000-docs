[Quaternion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) targetRotation; 
### Description
Returns the rotation of the target specified by [SetTarget](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animator.SetTarget.html).
The rotation is only valid when a frame is being evaluated after the [SetTarget](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animator.SetTarget.html) call. [Animator.applyRootMotion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animator-applyRootMotion.html) must be enabled for targetRotation to be calculated.
