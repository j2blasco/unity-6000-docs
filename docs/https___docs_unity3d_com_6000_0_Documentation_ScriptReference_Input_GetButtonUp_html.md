## Declaration
public static bool GetButtonUp(string buttonName); 
### Description
Returns true the first frame the user releases the virtual button identified by `buttonName`.
**Note** : This API is part of the legacy Input Manager. The recommended best practice is that you don't use this API in new projects. For new projects, use the Input System package. To learn more about input, refer to [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Input.html).  
  
Call this function from the [Update](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Update.html) function, since the state gets reset each frame. It will not return true until the user has pressed the button and released it again.  
  
Use this only when implementing action like events IE: shooting a weapon.  
Use [Input.GetAxis](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html) for any kind of movement behaviour.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public GameObject[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) projectile;
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        if (Input.GetButtonUp[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetButtonUp.html)("Fire1"))
            Instantiate(projectile, transform.position, transform.rotation);
    }
}

```
