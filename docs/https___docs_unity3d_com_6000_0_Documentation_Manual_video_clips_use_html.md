# Import and preview video clips
Import, preview, and view source information of video clips in your application.
A video clip asset is an imported video file, which you can reference in the [Video Player component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-VideoPlayer.html) to play video content in your application.
This information covers using video clip assets only. To use the Video Clip Importer, refer to [Video Clip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-VideoClip.html). To transcode video clips, refer to [Video transparency support](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VideoTransparency.html).
## Import your file as a video clip
To import your file as a video clip, do one of the following:
  * Click and drag a video file into the **Assets** folder.
  * Go to **Assets** > **Import New Asset** and select a video file.


Next, configure your [Video Clip Importer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-VideoClip.html) properties or [reference the video clip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/video-sources-reference.html#videoclip) in the Video Player.
