[MixedLightingMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MixedLightingMode.html) mixedBakeMode; 
### Description
Sets the [MixedLightingMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MixedLightingMode.html) that Unity uses for all Mixed Lights in the Scene. (Editor only).
Use this property to choose the [MixedLightingMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MixedLightingMode.html) for the Scene. This defines the real-time behavior of Mixed Lights and determines what lighting data from Mixed Lights is baked into lightmaps.  
  
This setting affects the real-time behaviour of lights, and lightmaps generated by the Baked Global Illumination system.  
  
When Unity serializes this `LightingSettings` object as a [Lighting Settings Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-LightingSettings.html), this property corresponds to the **Lighting Mode** property in the Lighting Settings Asset Inspector.
