### Description
Records profiling data produced by a specific Sampler.
Recorder accumulates elapsed time of every Begin/End pair during a frame. Once enabled it sums delta time between Begin and End samples produced by a Sampler. Use [elapsedNanoseconds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder-elapsedNanoseconds.html) to get the accumulated time for the previous frame.
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    Recorder[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder.html) behaviourUpdateRecorder;
    void Start()
    {
        behaviourUpdateRecorder = Recorder.Get[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder.Get.html)("BehaviourUpdate");
        behaviourUpdateRecorder.enabled = true;
    }  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        if (behaviourUpdateRecorder.isValid)
            Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("BehaviourUpdate time: " + behaviourUpdateRecorder.elapsedNanoseconds);
    }
}

```

**Note:** A Recorder collects data regardless of the Profiler state. When a Recorder is enabled, data is accumulated every time its Sampler is hit. This information is equivalent to the one you can see in Hierarchy view in the [Profiler Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ProfilerCPU.html).  
  
At the moment Samplers are available only in the Editor and Development Players. Use [Recorder.isValid](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder-isValid.html) to verify if Recorder can collect the data.  
  
Recorder supports only internal static Profiler labels and labels generated by [CustomSampler](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.CustomSampler.html). Dynamic internal labels produced by scripting method calls and labels produced by [Profiler.BeginSample](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Profiler.BeginSample.html) are not supported.

### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[elapsedNanoseconds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder-elapsedNanoseconds.html) | Accumulated time of Begin/End pairs for the previous frame in nanoseconds. (Read Only)  
[enabled](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder-enabled.html) | Enables recording.  
[gpuElapsedNanoseconds](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder-gpuElapsedNanoseconds.html) | Gets the accumulated GPU time, in nanoseconds, for a frame. The Recorder has a three frame delay so this gives the timings for the frame that was three frames before the one that you access this property on. (Read Only).  
[gpuSampleBlockCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder-gpuSampleBlockCount.html) | Gets the number of Begin/End time pairs that the GPU executed during a frame. The Recorder has a three frame delay so this gives the timings for the frame that was three frames before the one that you access this property on. (Read Only).  
[isValid](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder-isValid.html) | Returns true if Recorder is valid and can collect data. (Read Only)  
[sampleBlockCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder-sampleBlockCount.html) | Number of time Begin/End pairs was called during the previous frame. (Read Only)  
### Public Methods
Method | Description  
---|---  
[CollectFromAllThreads](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder.CollectFromAllThreads.html) | Configures the recorder to collect samples from all threads.  
[FilterToCurrentThread](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder.FilterToCurrentThread.html) | Configures the recorder to only collect data from the current thread.  
### Static Methods
Method | Description  
---|---  
[Get](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Profiling.Recorder.Get.html) | Use this function to get a Recorder for the specific Profiler label.
