### Description
A change of this type indicates that an asset object has been destroyed. This happens for example when [Undo.DestroyObjectImmediate](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.DestroyObjectImmediate.html) is used with an instance of an asset (e.g. [Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.html)). Note that this only covers destruction of asset objects in memory and not deletion of assets in the project on disk.
