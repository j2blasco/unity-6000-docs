## Declaration
public void ResetStereoViewMatrices(); 
### Description
Reset the camera to using the Unity computed view matrices for all stereoscopic eyes.
If Camera.SetStereoViewMatrices or [Camera.SetStereoViewMatrix](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.SetStereoViewMatrix.html) were used to provide custom view matrices, this method reverts the camera back to using view matrices provided by the VR SDK.
