# Introduction to lighting in the Universal Render Pipeline
All of Unityâ€™s render pipelines share common lighting functionality, but each **render pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) has some important differences.
In URP, the following applies:
  * The [Light component inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/light-component.html) displays some URP-specific controls.
  * The [Universal Additional Light Data](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/universal-additional-light-data.html) component allows Unity to store Light-related data that is specific to URP.
