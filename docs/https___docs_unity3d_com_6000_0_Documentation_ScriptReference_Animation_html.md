### Description
The animation component is used to play back animations.
You can assign animation clips to the animation component and control playback from your script. The animation system in Unity is weight-based and supports Animation Blending, Additive animations, Animation Mixing, Layers and full control over all aspects of playback.  
  
For an overview of animation scripting in Unity please [read this introduction](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationOverview.html).  
  
[AnimationState](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationState.html) can be used to change the layer of an animation, modify playback speed, and for direct control over blending and mixing.  
  
Also [Animation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animation.html) supports enumerators. Looping through all AnimationStates is performed like this:
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    public Animation[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animation.html) anim;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        anim = GetComponent<Animation[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animation.html)>();
        foreach (AnimationState[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationState.html) state in anim)
        {
            state.speed = 0.5F;
        }
    }
}

```
