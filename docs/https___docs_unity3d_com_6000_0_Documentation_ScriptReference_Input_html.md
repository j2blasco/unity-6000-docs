### Description
Interface into the Legacy Input system.
**Note** : The `Input` class is part of the legacy Input Manager. The recommended best practice is that you don't use this API in new projects. For new projects, use the Input System package. To learn more about input, refer to [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Input.html).  
  
[KeyCode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html) maps to physical keys only if "Use Physical Keys" is enabled in [Input Manager settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-InputManager.html), otherwise it maps to layout and platform dependent key mapping. Starting from 2022.1 "Use Physical Keys" is enabled by default.  
  
Use this class to read the axes set up in the [Conventional Game Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/ConventionalGameInput.html), and to access multi-touch/accelerometer data on mobile devices.  
  
To read an axis use [Input.GetAxis](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html) with one of the following default axes: "Horizontal" and "Vertical" are mapped to joystick, `A`, `W`, `S`, `D` and the arrow keys. "Mouse X" and "Mouse Y" are mapped to the mouse delta. "Fire1", "Fire2" "Fire3" are mapped to `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Cmd` keys and three mouse or joystick buttons. New input axes can be added. See [Input Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-InputManager.html) for this.  
  
If you are using input for any kind of movement behaviour use [Input.GetAxis](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html). It gives you smoothed and configurable input that can be mapped to a keyboard, joystick or mouse. Use [Input.GetButton](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetButton.html) for action-like events only. Do not use it for movement. [Input.GetAxis](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html) will make the script code smaller and simpler.  
  
**Note:** [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.html) flags are not reset until `Update`. You should make all the [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.html) calls in the `Update` Loop.  
  
Additional resources: [KeyCode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html) which lists all of the key press, mouse and joystick options.  
  
**Mobile Devices:**  
  
iOS and Android devices are capable of tracking multiple fingers touching the screen simultaneously. You can access data on the status of each finger touching screen during the last frame by using the [Input.touches](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input-touches.html) property array.  
  
As a device moves, its accelerometer hardware reports linear acceleration changes along the three primary axes in three-dimensional space. You can use this data to detect both the current orientation of the device (relative to the ground) and any immediate changes to that orientation.  
  
Acceleration along each axis is reported directly by the hardware as G-force values. A value of 1.0 represents a load of about +1g along a given axis while a value of -1.0 represents -1g. If you hold the device upright (with the home button at the bottom) in front of you, the X axis is positive along the right, the Y axis is positive directly up, and the Z axis is positive pointing toward you.  
  
You can use the [Input.acceleration](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input-acceleration.html) property to get the accelerometer reading. You can also use the [Input.deviceOrientation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input-deviceOrientation.html) property to get a discrete evaluation of the device's orientation in three-dimensional space. Detecting a change in orientation can be useful if you want to create game behaviors when the user rotates the device to hold it differently.  
  
Note that the accelerometer hardware can be polled more than once per frame. To access all accelerometer samples since the last frame, you can use the [Input.accelerationEvents](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input-accelerationEvents.html) property array. This can be useful when reconstructing player motions, feeding acceleration data into a predictor, or implementing other precise motion analysis.

This component relates to legacy methods for drawing UI textures and images to the screen. You should instead use UI system. This is also unrelated to the IMGUI system.
