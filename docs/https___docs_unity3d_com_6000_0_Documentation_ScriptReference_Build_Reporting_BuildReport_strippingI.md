[Build.Reporting.StrippingInfo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Build.Reporting.StrippingInfo.html) strippingInfo; 
### Description
The [StrippingInfo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Build.Reporting.StrippingInfo.html) object for the build.
The StrippingInfo object contains information about which native code modules in the engine are still present in the build, and the reasons why they are still present.  
  
This is only available when building for platforms that support code stripping. When building for other platforms, this property will be null.
