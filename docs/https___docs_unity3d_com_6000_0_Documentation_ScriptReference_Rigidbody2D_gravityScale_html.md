gravityScale; 
### Description
The degree to which this object is affected by gravity.
In 2D physics, the gravity is a global setting in the Physics2D class but you can also control the proportion of that gravity applied to each object individually using _gravityScale_. For example, it may be easier to implement a flying character by turning off its gravity rather than simulating the forces that keep it aloft.
