# Manually edit the physics shape
You can create your own custom physics shape and edit it in two ways. The first way is by automatically [generating](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-editor/custom-physics-shape/generate-physics-shape.html) an outline, and then moving the control points of the generated outline to further refine it. Alternatively, click and drag over any space in the Custom Physics Shape editor window to create a rectangular outline with four control points and begin refining the outline by moving the control points or adding and removing them.
