### Description
Determines if this light will cast soft or hard shadows, or not cast shadows at all.
Changing this setting can significantly affect visual quality and performance. Typically, turning shadows off boosts performance dramatically at the expense of realism and depth, while enabling soft shadows enhances realism, depth, and visual fidelity at significant performance costs.
