### Description
A change of this type indicates that an asset object has been created. This happens for example when [Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo.html) is used with an instance of an asset (e.g. [Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture.html)). Note that this only covers creation of asset objects in memory and not creation of new assets in the project on disk.
