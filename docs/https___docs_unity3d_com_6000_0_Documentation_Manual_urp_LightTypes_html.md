[Introduction to the 2D lighting system in URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/Lights-2D-intro.html) | Understand the tools and runtime components to create a lit 2D **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) with 2D lighting features.
