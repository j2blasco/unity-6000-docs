### Description
Produces debug metadata files with `.so` extension in the zip package.
By default, gradle produces debug metadata files with `.so.sym` or `.so.dbg` extensions. Use this option to create debug metadata files with `.so` extension for the distribution services which donâ€™t recognize the default extensions.
