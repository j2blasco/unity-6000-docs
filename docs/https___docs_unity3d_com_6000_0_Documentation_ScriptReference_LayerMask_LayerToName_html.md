**Note:** [LayerToName](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LayerMask.LayerToName.html) takes an integer argument. This argument selects the name of Layer and returns it. The layers are listed in the inspector. As an example assume User Layer 13 has a string. This string can be accessed by calling [LayerToName](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LayerMask.LayerToName.html) with the value 2^13, which is 8192.
