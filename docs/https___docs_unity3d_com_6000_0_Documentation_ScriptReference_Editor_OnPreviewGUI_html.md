## Declaration
public void OnPreviewGUI([Rect](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html) r, [GUIStyle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUIStyle.html) background); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
r | The rectangle in which to draw the preview.  
background | Background image.  
### Description
Creates a custom preview for the preview area of the Inspector, the headers of the primary Editor, and the object selector.  
  
You must implement [Editor.HasPreviewGUI](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.HasPreviewGUI.html) for this method to be called.
If you implement [OnInteractivePreviewGUI](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Editor.OnInteractivePreviewGUI.html), then this method is only called for non-interactive custom previews. The overidden method should render a preview of the asset in the specified rectangle (r). The default implementation is a no-op.  
  
**Note:** Inspector previews are limited to the primary Editor of persistent objects, such as GameObjectInspector, MaterialEditor, and TextureInspector. A component cannot have its own Inspector preview.
