y; 
### Description
The Y coordinate of the rectangle.
This value is the same as [yMin](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect-yMin.html), but setting it will move the rectangle rather than resize it.
```
using UnityEngine;  
  
public class RectExample : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Start()
    {
        Rect[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html) rect = new Rect[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rect.html)(10, 10, 50, 30);
        // prints: y = 10
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)("y = " + rect.y);  
  
        rect.y = 20;
        // prints: (x:10, y:20, width:50, height:30)
        Debug.Log[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html)(rect);
    }
}
