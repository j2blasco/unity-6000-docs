## Declaration
public static void ComputeHash128(void* data, ulong dataSize, ulong* hash1, ulong* hash2); 
## Declaration
public static void ComputeHash128(void* data, ulong dataSize, Hash128* hash); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
data | Pointer to the data to hash.  
dataSize | The number of bytes to hash.  
hash1 | A pointer to store the low 64 bits of the computed hash.  
hash2 | A pointer to store the high 64 bits of the computed hash.  
hash | A pointer to the Hash128 to updated with the computed hash.  
### Description
Compute a 128 bit hash based on a data.
