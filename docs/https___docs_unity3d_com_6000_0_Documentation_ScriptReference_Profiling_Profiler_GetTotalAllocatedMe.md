## Declaration
public static long GetTotalAllocatedMemoryLong(); 
### Returns
**long** The amount of memory allocated by Unity. This returns 0 if the Profiler is not available. 
### Description
The total memory allocated by the internal allocators in Unity. Unity reserves large pools of memory from the system; this includes double the required memory for textures because Unity keeps a copy of each texture on both the CPU and GPU. This function returns the amount of used memory in those pools.
