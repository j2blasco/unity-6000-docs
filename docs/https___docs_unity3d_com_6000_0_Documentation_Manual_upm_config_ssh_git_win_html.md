# Load SSH keys automatically on Windows (OpenSSH)
If you use Windows and its built-in OpenSSH client, follow these steps to configure the OpenSSH client so you can use your passphrase-protected SSH key without prompts.
## Prerequisites
  * Windows 10 or later.


## Before you begin
Check if you have any existing SSH keys. Refer to the GitHub Docs article, [Checking for existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys).
If you don’t have an SSH key:
  1. Create one by following the GitHub Docs article, [Generating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
  2. Add the new SSH key to your GitHub account, by following the GitHub Docs article, [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).


## Procedure
  1. Check if `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\.ssh\config` exists. **Note** : In some applications, such as Git Bash, `.ssh` is a hidden subdirectory.
  2. Create `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\.ssh\config` if it doesn’t exist.
  3. Add the following content to `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\.ssh\config` to set the key to load in the authentication agent and specify its use by the target server. Make sure you add this entry before any global settings marked as `Host *`.
```
Host SERVER_NAME
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile FILE_PATH

```

     * `SERVER_NAME` is the server that uses the file specified by `IdentityFile`. A sample value is `github.com`.
     * `FILE_PATH` is the fully qualified path to the SSH file you created. A sample value is `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\.ssh\<FILE>`, where `<FILE>` might be `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, or a custom name.
Example:
```
Host github.com
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile C:/Users/user1/.ssh/id_ed25519

```

  4. Open the Windows PowerShell, making sure you open it by selecting **Run as Administrator**.
  5. Configure the SSH Authentication Agent service so it starts each time you reboot your computer, by running the following command:
```
Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic

```

  6. Start the service, by running the following command:
```
Start-Service ssh-agent

```

  7. Check that the service is running, by running the following command and confirming that the `Status` value is `Running`:
```
Get-Service ssh-agent

```

  8. Load your key file into the `ssh-agent`, replacing `<FILE>` with the actual file name of your key, then type your passphrase, if prompted.
```
ssh-add $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\<FILE>

```

Example:
```
ssh-add $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519

```

  9. Make sure Git uses the Windows OpenSSH client instead of the SSH client included with Git, by using either of the following methods:
     * For system-wide configuration, create an environment variable named `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` with a value of `C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe`. **Important** : Make sure you use forward slashes in the path.
     * To set the configuration for a specific scope, run the following `git config` command in a terminal. Refer to the [git config documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) for details. For example:
```
git config --global core.sshCommand C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe

```

**Important** : Make sure you use forward slashes in the path.


You can now use the Unity Package Manager to fetch packages from that Git repository over SSH using your passphrase-protected SSH key.
