## Declaration
public delegate void EventHandler([Video.VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) source); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
source | The [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) that emits the event.  
### Description
Delegate type for all events without parameters emitted by [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html)s.
Use this EventHandler to define what you want to happen when the [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) emits certain events. This EventHandler accepts the following VideoPlayer events: 
  * [VideoPlayer.loopPointReached](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-loopPointReached.html)
  * [VideoPlayer.started](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-started.html)
  * [VideoPlayer.prepareCompleted](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-prepareCompleted.html)
  * [VideoPlayer.seekCompleted](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-seekCompleted.html)


This EventHandler doesn't accept events that have parameters.   
  
Additional resources: For EventHandlers that can accept parameters, refer to VideoPlayer.ErrorEventHandler which handles [VideoPlayer.errorReceived](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-errorReceived.html), VideoPlayer.FrameReadyEventHandler which handles [VideoPlayer.frameReady](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer-frameReady.html), and VideoPlayer.TimeEventHandler.
