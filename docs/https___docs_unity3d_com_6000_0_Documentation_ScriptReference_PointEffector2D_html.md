### Description
Applies forces to attract/repulse against a point.
When the source [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) is a trigger, the effector will apply forces whenever the target [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) overlaps the source. When the source [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider.html) isn't a trigger, the effector will apply forces whenever the target [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) is in contact with the source only.  
  
This effector is designed primarily to work with source [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) that are set as triggers so that target [Collider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collider2D.html) can overlap the defined area.
