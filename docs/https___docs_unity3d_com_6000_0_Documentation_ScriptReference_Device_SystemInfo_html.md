### Description
Access platform-specific system and hardware information.
This class has the same functionality as [SystemInfo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo.html) and also mimics platform-specific behavior in the Unity Editor. Use it together with the Device Simulator to test platform-specific behaviors inside the Editor. Outside of the Editor, this class behaves exactly like the [SystemInfo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo.html) class. Unity strips all simulation capabilities during the build process. Use the original [SystemInfo](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo.html) class if you work directly with the Unity Editor (for example, to create a custom Editor tool) and you don't need to use any simulated values.
