## Declaration
public static float SmoothStep(float from, float to, float t); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
from | The start of the range.  
to | The end of the range.  
t | The interpolation value between the `from` and `to` range limits.  
### Returns
**float** The interpolated float result between `from` and `to`. 
### Description
Interpolates between `from` and `to` with smoothing at the limits.
This function interpolates between `from` and `to` in a similar way to [Lerp](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mathf.Lerp.html). However, the interpolation will gradually speed up from the start and slow down toward the end. This is useful for creating natural-looking animation, fading and other transitions.  
  
The parameter `t` is clamped to the range [0, 1].

public class Example : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    // Minimum and maximum values for the transition.
    float minimum = 10.0f;
    float maximum = 20.0f;  
  
    // Time[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time.html) taken for the transition.
    float duration = 5.0f;  
  
    float startTime;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        // Make a note of the time the script started.
        startTime = Time.time[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-time.html);
    }  
  
    void Update[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    {
        // Calculate the fraction of the total duration that has passed.
        float t = (Time.time[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-time.html) - startTime) / duration;
        transform.position = new Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html)(Mathf.SmoothStep[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mathf.SmoothStep.html)(minimum, maximum, t), 0, 0);
    }
