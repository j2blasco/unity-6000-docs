# Overview
Unity supports **XR** An umbrella term encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) applications. Devices supporting these forms of interactive applications can be referred to as XR devices. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/XR.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#XR) development on multiple platforms and devices through its XR **plug-in** A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Plug-in) framework. Unity also provides a set of packages that add features and developer tools for building XR games and applications. This section provides an overview of the supported platforms and describes the software architecture behind the XR plug-in framework.
Topic | Description  
---|---  
[XR packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/xr-support-packages.html) | Plug-ins and other packages that support XR development.  
[AR overview](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AROverview.html) | Get started with **augmented reality** Augmented Reality (AR) uses computer graphics or video composited on top of a live video feed to augment the view and create interaction with real and virtual objects. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AugmentedReality) development in Unity.  
[VR and MR overview](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VROverview.html) | Get started with **virtual reality** Virtual Reality (VR) immerses users in an artificial 3D world of realistic images and sounds, using a headset and motion tracking. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#VirtualReality) and **mixed reality** Mixed Reality (MR) combines its own virtual environment with the userâ€™s real-world environment and allows them to interact with each other.

[XR architecture](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/XRPluginArchitecture.html) | Describes the XR plug-in framework.  
[XR API reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/VRReference.html) | Understand the common APIs for XR development that Unity provides.
