[LightmapsMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LightmapsMode.html) lightmapsMode; 
### Description
NonDirectional or CombinedDirectional Specular lightmaps rendering mode.
Note: this property is only serialized when building the player. In all the other cases it's the responsibility of the Unity lightmapping system (or a custom script that brings external lightmapping data) to set it when the Scene loads or playmode is entered.  
  
You can continue reading [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/LightmappingDirectional.html) if you want to know what the different lightmap modes do.
