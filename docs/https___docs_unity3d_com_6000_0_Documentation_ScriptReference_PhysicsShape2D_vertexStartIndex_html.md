vertexStartIndex; 
### Description
The start index for the geometry of this shape within the [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html).
Multiple [PhysicsShape2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShape2D.html) in a [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html) are represented as a single list of vertices. This index is the start of this shape within that list.
