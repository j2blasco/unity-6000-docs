### Description
Compressed two-channel (RG) texture format.
BC5 format compresses textures to 8 bits per pixel, keeping only the red and green color channels. It is widely supported on PC and console platforms.  
  
It is a good format to compress two-channel textures, e.g. as a compression format for tangent space normal maps or velocity fields. For one channel textures, see [BC4](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureFormat.BC4.html).
