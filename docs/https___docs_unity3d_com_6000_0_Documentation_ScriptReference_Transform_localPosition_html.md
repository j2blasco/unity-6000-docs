[Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) localPosition; 
### Description
Position of the transform relative to the parent transform.
If the transform has no parent, it is the same as [Transform.position](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-position.html).
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void Example()
    {
        // Move the object to the same position as the parent:
        transform.localPosition = new Vector3[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html)(0, 0, 0);  
  
        // Get the y component of the position relative to the parent
        // and print it to the Console
        print(transform.localPosition.y);
    }
}

```
î¥£
Note that the parent transform's world rotation and scale are applied to the local position when calculating the world position. This means that while 1 unit in [Transform.position](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-position.html) is always 1 unit, 1 unit in [Transform.localPosition](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-localPosition.html) will get scaled by the scale of all ancestors.
