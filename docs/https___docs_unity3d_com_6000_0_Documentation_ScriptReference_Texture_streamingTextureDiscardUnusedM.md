streamingTextureDiscardUnusedMips; 
### Description
This property forces the streaming Texture system to discard all unused mipmaps instead of caching them until the Texture [memory budget](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/TextureStreaming#memory-budget.html) is exceeded. This is useful when you profile or write tests to keep a predictable set of Textures in memory.
