### Description
Use this struct to set up a sphere cast command that is performed asynchronously during a job.
When you use this struct to schedule a batch of sphere casts, the sphere casts are performed asynchronously and in parallel. The results of each sphere casts are written to the results buffer. Since the results are written asynchronously, you cannot access the results buffer until the job is completed.  
  
The results for a command at index N in the command buffer are stored at index N * maxHits in the results buffer.  
  
Spherecast command also allows you to control whether or not Trigger colliders and back-face triangles generate a hit. Use [QueryParameters](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/QueryParameters.html) to control hit flags.  
  
Note: Only BatchQuery.ExecuteSpherecastJob is logged into the profiler. Query count information is not logged.
