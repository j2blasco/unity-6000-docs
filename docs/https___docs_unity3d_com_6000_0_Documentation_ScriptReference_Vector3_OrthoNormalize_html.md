## Declaration
public static void OrthoNormalize(ref [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) normal, ref [Vector3](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) tangent); 
### Description
Makes vectors normalized and orthogonal to each other.
Normalizes `normal`. Normalizes `tangent` and makes sure it is orthogonal to `normal` (that is, angle between them is 90 degrees).

### Description
Makes vectors normalized and orthogonal to each other.
Normalizes `normal`. Normalizes `tangent` and makes sure it is orthogonal to `normal`. Normalizes `binormal` and makes sure it is orthogonal to both `normal` and `tangent`.  
  
Points in space are usually specified with coordinates in the standard XYZ axis system. However, you can interpret any three vectors as "axes" if they are normalized (ie, have a magnitude of 1) and are orthogonal (ie, perpendicular to each other).  
  
Creating your own coordinate axes is useful, say, if you want to scale a mesh in arbitrary directions rather than just along the XYZ axes - you can transform the vertices to your own coordinate system, scale them and then transform back. Often, a transformation like this will be carried out along only one axis while the other two are either left as they are or treated equally. For example, a stretching effect can be applied to a mesh by scaling up on one axis while scaling down proportionally on the other two. This means that once the first axis vector is specified, it doesn't greatly matter what the other two are as long as they are normalized and orthogonal. OrthoNormalize can be used to ensure the first vector is normal and then generate two normalized, orthogonal vectors for the other two axes.
