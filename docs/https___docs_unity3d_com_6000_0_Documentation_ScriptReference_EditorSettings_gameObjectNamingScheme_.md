[EditorSettings.NamingScheme](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorSettings.NamingScheme.html) gameObjectNamingScheme; 
### Description
Indicates which naming scheme to use for duplicated GameObjects.
When a GameObject is duplicated or instantiated, Unity copies the original GameObject's name and appends it with successive numbers. Unity supports several naming schemes, with the default being [EditorSettings.NamingScheme.SpaceParenthesis](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/EditorSettings.NamingScheme.SpaceParenthesis.html).  
  
For example, when a GameObject named "Prefab" its duplicated or instantiated, Unity names it "Prefab (1)", and then "Prefab (2)" if it is duplicated or instantiated again.
