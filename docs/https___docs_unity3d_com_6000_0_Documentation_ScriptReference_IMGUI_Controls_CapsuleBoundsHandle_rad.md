### Description
Returns or specifies the radius of the capsule bounding volume.
A negative value will automatically be converted into a positive value. If only a single radius axis is enabled, the value will automatically be converted to `0`. This value can never exceed half the [height](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/IMGUI.Controls.CapsuleBoundsHandle-height.html).
