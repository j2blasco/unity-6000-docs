### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
desiredAccuracyInMeters | The service accuracy you want to use, in meters. This determines the accuracy of the device's last location coordinates. Higher values like 500 don't require the device to use its GPS chip and thus save battery power. Lower values like 5-10 provide the best accuracy but require the GPS chip and thus use more battery power. The default value is 10 meters.  
updateDistanceInMeters | The minimum distance, in meters, that the device must move laterally before Unity updates [Input.location](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input-location.html). Higher values like 500 produce fewer updates and are less resource intensive to process. The default is 10 meters.  
### Description
Starts location service updates.
After you call this function, you can access the device's last location coordinates by checking [lastData](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LocationService-lastData.html) in [Input.location](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input-location.html).  
  
**Note** : The location service doesn't start to send location data immediately. Therefore, check the [current service status](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/LocationService-status.html) in [Input.location](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input-location.html).  
  
On Android, using this method in scripts automatically adds the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission to the android manifest. If you use low accuracy values like 500 or higher, select **Low Accuracy Location** in [Player Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettings.html) to add the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission instead.  
  
On WebGL, this method must be invoked as a response to a user gesture (such as a mouse click) within a coroutine. **Note:** Geolocation services are available only with an HTTPS connection, except during development when you might use http://localhost. The use of `desiredAccuracyInMeters` and `updateDistanceInMeters` isn't supported since the user device determines those two values.
