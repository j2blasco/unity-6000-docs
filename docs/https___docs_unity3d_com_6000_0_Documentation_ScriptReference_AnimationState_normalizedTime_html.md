normalizedTime; 
### Description
Normalized time of the State.
The normalized time is a progression ratio. The integer part is the number of times the State has looped. The fractional part is a percentage (0-1) that represents the progress of the current loop. For example, a normalized time of 0.5 means that the State has not looped (0) and is halfway (50% or .5) through the first loop.

    public Animation[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animation.html) anim;  
  
    void Start()
    {
        // Fast forward to the middle of the animation
        anim["Walk"].normalizedTime = 0.5f;
    }
