# Legacy prebuilt shaders
Prior to the introduction of the [Physically Based Standard Shader](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-StandardShader.html), Unity was supplied with more than eighty built-in shaders which each served different purposes. These shaders are still included and available for use in Unity for backwards compatibility but we recommend you use the Standard **Shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Shader) wherever possible for new projects.
This section begins by explaining how to use the legacy built-in shaders to maximum effect. The remainder of the section details all the available shaders, grouped into related “families”.
