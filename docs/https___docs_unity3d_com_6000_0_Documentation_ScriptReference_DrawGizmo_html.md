### Description
The DrawGizmo attribute allows you to supply a gizmo renderer for any [Component](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.html).
The renderer function must be static, and take two parameters: the object for which the gizmo is being drawn, and a [GizmoType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GizmoType.html) parameter which indicates the context in which the gizmo is being drawn.  
  
The renderer function can be defined in any class, including editor scripts. This allows you to keep your gizmo-drawing code out of your component scripts so that it is not included in builds.  
  
Additional resources: [GizmoType](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/GizmoType.html).
