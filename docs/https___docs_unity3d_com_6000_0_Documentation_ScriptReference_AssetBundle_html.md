### Description
API for accessing the content of AssetBundle files.
This class exposes an API, via static methods, for loading and managing AssetBundles.  
  
This same class offers non-static methods and properties that expose the contents of a specific loaded AssetBundle, including the ability to load an Asset from within an AssetBundle.  
  
Create AssetBundles by calling [BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles.html) or using the [Addressables package](http://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@latest/index.html). The build process generates one or more AssetBundle files, and each AssetBundle file contains a serialized instance of this class.  
  
Note: AssetBundle.LoadAsset, and the other Load methods, do not support loading Scenes from AssetBundles. Instead, in runtime you load the streamed scene AssetBundle and then call [SceneManager.LoadScene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html) or [SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync.html) with the Scene name. In the Editor it is not supported to load Scenes from AssetBundles so calls to [EditorSceneManager.OpenScene](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.OpenScene.html) will fail with an error that the Scene file is not found.
