jointFriction; 
### Description
Allows you to specify the amount of friction that is applied as a result of the parent body moving relative to this body.
This works alongside drive damping, linear damping and angular damping. The joint friction is proportional to the suspended load of the joint.   
Unit of measurement - 1/s.
