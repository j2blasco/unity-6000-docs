# How Unity builds iOS applications
Unity uses [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to build iOS applications. You can use [iOS Player settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsiOS.html) to configure most aspects of the final build. However, for more granular control, building an Xcode project allows you to directly modify Xcode project files.
## The build process
  1. Unity collects project resources, code libraries, and **plug-ins** A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Plug-in) from your Unity project and uses them to create a valid [Xcode project](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/StructureOfXcodeProject.html).
  2. Unity updates the Xcode project based on the Unity projectâ€™s **Player settings** Settings that let you set various player-specific options for the final game built by Unity. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettings.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#PlayerSettings) and build settings. Depending on whether you use [replace or append mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/iphone-BuildProcess.html#replace-and-append-mode), Unity replaces or preserves previous changes you made. Append mode preserves changes you previously made and only overwrites certain values. Replace mode creates a new project which overwrites any changes you previously made.
  3. Unity generates C++ source files based on your C# **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scripts) and places them in the generated Xcode project. Xcode then invokes the [IL2CPP](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scripting-backends-il2cpp.html)A Unity-developed scripting back-end which you can use as an alternative to Mono when building projects for some platforms. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/scripting-backends-il2cpp.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#IL2CPP) program which compiles the C++ source files into libraries called `libGameAssembly.a` and `il2cpp.a`.
  4. Xcode builds the project into a standalone application and deploys and launches it on a connected device or the [Xcode simulator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device).


## Incremental build pipeline
Unity uses the [incremental build pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/incremental-build-pipeline.html) when it generates the Xcode project for iOS. This means that Unity incrementally builds and generates files such as [Information Property List](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/AboutInformationPropertyListFiles.html) (plist) files and [Entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements) files. If you implement callbacks that modify or move any iOS file or asset that the incremental build pipeline uses, refer to [Creating non-incremental builds](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/incremental-build-pipeline.html#creating-non-incremental-builds).
