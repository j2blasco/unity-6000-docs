### Description
Configure how a Particle System is baked into a texture.
### Properties
Property | Description  
---|---  
[BakeRotationAndScale](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemBakeTextureOptions.BakeRotationAndScale.html) | Bake the Transform rotation and scale into the texture.  
[BakePosition](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemBakeTextureOptions.BakePosition.html) | Bake the Transform position into the texture.  
[PerVertex](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemBakeTextureOptions.PerVertex.html) | Bake each vertex of each particle (i.e. 4 vertices per billboard).  
[PerParticle](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemBakeTextureOptions.PerParticle.html) | Only bake each particle, instead of each vertex of each particle (i.e. 1 vertex per billboard).  
[IncludeParticleIndices](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemBakeTextureOptions.IncludeParticleIndices.html) | Instead of only baking triangle indices into the indices texture, bake a 2 channel index texture containing triangle indices and particle indices.  
[Default](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemBakeTextureOptions.Default.html) | The default baking options.
