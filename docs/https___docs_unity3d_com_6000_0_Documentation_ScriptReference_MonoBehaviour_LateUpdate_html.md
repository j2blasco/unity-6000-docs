### Description
LateUpdate is called every frame, if the [Behaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Behaviour.html) is enabled.
LateUpdate is called after all Update functions have been called. This is useful to order script execution. For example a follow camera should always be implemented in LateUpdate because it tracks objects that might have moved inside Update.
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)
{
    void LateUpdate()
    {
        transform.Translate(0, Time.deltaTime[](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html), 0);
    }
}

```
î¥£
In order to get the elapsed time since last call to LateUpdate, use [Time.deltaTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html). This function is only called if the [Behaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Behaviour.html) is enabled. Override this function in order to provide your component's functionality.
