## Declaration
public static bool RequestStoreReview(); 
### Returns
**bool** Value indicating whether the underlying API is available or not. False indicates that the iOS version isn't recent enough or that the StoreKit framework is not linked with the app. 
### Description
Request App Store rating and review from the user.
Use this method to indicate when it makes sense within the user experience flow of your application to ask the user for a review. Don't use buttons or other controls to request feedback because the actual display of a rating request is rate-limited and the user can opt-out of receiving these prompts. Make sure the user has demonstrated an engagement with your application before asking for a review. This will display the default Apple prompt that cannot be modified.
