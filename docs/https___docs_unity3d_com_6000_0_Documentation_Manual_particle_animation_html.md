# Particle animations
Particle animations are typically simpler and less detailed than character animations. In systems where the particles are visible individually, animations can be used to convey actions or movements. For example, flames may flicker and insects in a swarm might vibrate or shudder as if flapping their wings. In cases where the particles form a single, continuous entity like a cloud, animated particles can help add to the impression of energy and movement.
The [Texture Sheet Animation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/PartSysTexSheetAnimModule.html) module treats the Texture as a grid of separate sub-images that can be played back as frames of animation.
You can use the **Single Row** mode to create separate animation sequences for particles and switch between animations from a script. This can be useful for creating variation or switching to a different animation after a **collision** A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Collision). The **Random Row** option is highly effective as a way to break up conspicuous regularity in a **particle system** A component that simulates fluid entities such as liquids, clouds and flames by generating and animating large numbers of small 2D images in the scene. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ParticleSystem.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#particlesystem) (for example, a group of flame objects that are all repeating the exact same flickering animation over and over again). This option can also be used with a single frame per row as a way to generate particles with random graphics. This can be used to break up regularity in a object like a cloud or to produce different types of debris or other objects from a single system. For example, a blunderbuss might fire out a cluster of nails, bolts, balls and other projectiles, or a car crash effect may result in springs, car paint, screws and other bits of metal being emitted.
Use the **Row Mode** property to break up conspicuous regularity in a Particle System (for example, a group of GameObjects that all repeat an identical flickering animation over and over again). To generate particles with random graphics, use this property with a single frame per row. This is useful for breaking up regularity in a single system, such as cloud, or to produce different types of debris. For example, a gun might fire out a cluster of nails, bolts and other projectiles, or a car crash effect could emit springs, car paint, screws and other bits of metal.
UV flipping is a great way to add more visual variety to your effects without needing to author additional textures.
Selecting the **Sprites** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) option from the Mode dropdown allows you to define a list of sprites to be displayed for each particle, instead of using a regular grid of frames on a texture. Using this mode allows you to take advantage of many of the features of sprites, such as the Sprite Packer, custom pivots and different sizes per Sprite frame. The Sprite Packer can help you share materials between different Particle Systems, by atlasing your textures, which in turn can improve performance via **Dynamic Batching** An automatic Unity process which attempts to render multiple meshes as if they were a single mesh for optimized graphics performance. The technique transforms all of the GameObject vertices on the CPU and groups many similar vertices together. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/DrawCallBatching.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#DynamicBatching). There are some limitations to be aware of with this mode. Most importantly, all sprites attached to a Particle System must share the same texture. This can be achieved by using a Multiple Mode Sprite, or by using the Sprite Packer. If using custom pivot points for each Sprite, please note that you cannot blend between their frames, because the geometry will be different between each frame. Only simple sprites are supported, not 9 slice. Also be aware that **Mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Mesh) particles do not support custom pivots or varying Sprite sizes.
