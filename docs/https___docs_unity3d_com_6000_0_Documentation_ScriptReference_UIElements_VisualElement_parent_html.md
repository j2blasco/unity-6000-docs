[UIElements.VisualElement](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.VisualElement.html) parent; 
### Description
The parent of this VisualElement. 
Unlike the Hierarchy.parent property, this property reflects for logical hierarchy. For example, if you add an element to a [ScrollView](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.ScrollView.html), the logical parent of this element is the ScrollView itself, whereas the physical parent returned by the Hierarchy.parent property returns a child of [ScrollView](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/UIElements.ScrollView.html) which acts as the parent of your element.
