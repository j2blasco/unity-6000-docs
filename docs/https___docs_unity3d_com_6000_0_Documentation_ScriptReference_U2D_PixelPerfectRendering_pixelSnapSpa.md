pixelSnapSpacing; 
### Description
To achieve a pixel perfect render, Sprites must be displaced to discrete positions at render time. This value defines the minimum distance between these positions. This doesnâ€™t affect the GameObject's transform position.
By default, a Sprite can be moved freely along all axes of the world space. By setting this property to a non-zero positive value, Sprite movement will always appear displaced to multiples of this value at render time.  
  
For a pixel perfect render, this value should be set to the size of a single on-screen pixel. Calculate this value with [Camera.orthographicSize](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-orthographicSize.html) * 2.0 / [Camera.pixelHeight](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-pixelHeight.html) , when viewing the world space through the Orthographic Camera.  
  
This property is to be used together with the PixelPerfectCamera component for complete configuration of pixel perfect rendering.
