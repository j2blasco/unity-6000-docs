# Animator Window
Use the **Animator Window** to create, view, and modify Animator Controller assets.
![The Animator Controller Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/MecanimAnimatorControllerWindow.png) The Animator Controller Window
The Animator Controller window always displays the **state machine** The set of states in an Animator Controller that a character or animated GameObject can be in, along with a set of transitions between those states and a variable to remember the current state. The states available will depend on the type of gameplay, but typical states include things like idling, walking, running and jumping. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/StateMachineBasics.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#StateMachine) from the most recently selected `.controller` asset, regardless of which **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene) is loaded.
The Animator Controller window contains:
  * [Animation Layers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationLayers.html)An Animation Layer contains an Animation State Machine that controls animations of a model or part of it. An example of this is if you have a full-body layer for walking or jumping and a higher layer for upper-body motions such as throwing an object or shooting. The higher layers take precedence for the body parts they control. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationLayers.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AnimationLayer)
  * [Event Parameters](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationParameters.html)
  * A layout area where you create, arrange, and connect states for your [Animator Controller](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Animator.html)Controls animation through Animation Layers with Animation State Machines and Animation Blend Trees, controlled by Animation Parameters. The same Animator Controller can be referenced by multiple models with Animator components. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-AnimatorController.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AnimatorController).


You can right-click on the grid to create a new state node. Use the middle mouse button or press **Alt** (macOS: **Option**) and drag to pan the layout area. Click to select and edit a state node. Click and drag a state node to rearrange your state machine.
![The Parameters view with two parameters created](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AnimatorWindowParametersPane.png) The Parameters view with two parameters created
Use the Parameters view to create, view, and edit [Animator Controller Parameters](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationParameters.html). These are variables you define that act as inputs for the state machine. To add a parameter, click the Plus icon and select the parameter type from the context menu. To delete a parameter, select the parameter in the list and press **Delete** (macOS: **Ctrl+Delete**).
![The Layers view](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AnimatorWindowLayersPane.png) The Layers view
Use the Layers view to create, view, and edit [layers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AnimationLayers.html)Layers in Unity can be used to selectively opt groups of GameObjects in or out of certain processes or calculations. This includes camera rendering, lighting, physics collisions, or custom calculations in your own code. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Layers.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Layer) for your Animator Controller. You can control each layer with a different state machine. For example, you can have a base layer that controls the overall animation of your character and a second layer that controls the upper-body animation of your character.
![The Eye icon](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AnimatorWindowEyeIcon.png) The Eye icon
Enable or disable the Eye icon to display or hide the Parameters and Layers side pane. Hide the side pane to have more room to edit your state machine.
![The breadcrumb list](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AnimatorWindowBreadcrumbLocation.png) The breadcrumb list
States can contain [sub-states](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/NestedStateMachines.html) and [blend trees](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-BlendTree.html). You can nest these structures repeatedly. When you are viewing a sub-state or blend tree within another state, the breadcrumb list displays the nested hierarchy. Select an item in the breadcrumb list to display the state, sub-state, or blend tree.
![The lock icon](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/uploads/Main/AnimatorWindowLockIcon.png) The lock icon
Enable the lock icon to focus the Animator Window on the current state machine. When the lock icon is enabled, the Animator window shows the same state machine regardless of whether a different animator asset or **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#GameObject) is selected. When the lock icon is disabled and you select a different animator asset or another Game Object with an **animator component** A component on a model that animates that model using the Animation system. The component has a reference to an Animator Controller asset that controls the animation. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-AnimatorController.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#AnimatorComponent), the Animator Window displays the state machine for newly selected asset or GameObject.
