### Description
Reads the default repeat mode set higher up.
If you haven't changed wrapMode on [AnimationClip](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationClip.html) or on [Animation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Animation.html), then [WrapMode.Default](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WrapMode.Default.html) resolves to [WrapMode.Once](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WrapMode.Once.html).  
  
Additional resources: [WrapMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/WrapMode.html) for me details.
