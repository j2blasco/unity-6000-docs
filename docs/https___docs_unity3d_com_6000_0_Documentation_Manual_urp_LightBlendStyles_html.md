# Light Blend Styles component reference for URP
Find the **Light Blend Styles** settings in the [2D Renderer Data asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/2DRendererData-overview.html) to customize the way that the light interacts with **sprites** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Sprite) in the **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Scene). 
The asset can contain a total of four different **Light Blend Styles** , each with a different combination of Blend Style settings by default. All lights in the scene must pick from one of these available **Light Blend Styles**. When you create a light, itâ€™s automatically assigned the first Blend Style listed in the asset.
