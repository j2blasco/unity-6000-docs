## Declaration
public static string[] GetDependencies(string pathName); 
## Declaration
public static string[] GetDependencies(string pathName, bool recursive); 
### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
pathName | The path to the asset for which dependencies are required.  
recursive | Controls whether this method recursively checks and returns all dependencies including indirect dependencies (when set to true), or whether it only returns direct dependencies (when set to false).  
### Returns
**string[]** The paths of all assets that the input depends on. 
### Description
Returns an array of all the assets that are dependencies of the asset at the specified **pathName**.  
  
**Note:** [GetDependencies](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetDatabase.GetDependencies.html)() gets the Assets that are referenced by other Assets. For example, a Scene could contain many GameObjects with a Material attached to them. In this case, [GetDependencies](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetDatabase.GetDependencies.html)() will return the path to the Material Assets, but not the GameObjects as those are not Assets on your disk.
If **recursive** is true, the list returned will also include the input path itself. Note that this function returns all assets that are referenced by the input asset; these references are not necessarily required during the build process.

### Parameters
Parameter | Description  
---|---  
pathNames | The path to the assets for which dependencies are required.  
recursive | Controls whether this method recursively checks and returns all dependencies including indirect dependencies (when set to true), or whether it only returns direct dependencies (when set to false).  
### Returns
**string[]** The paths of all assets that the input depends on. 
### Description
Returns an array of the paths of assets that are dependencies of all the assets in the list of **pathName** s that you provide.  
  
**Note:** [GetDependencies](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetDatabase.GetDependencies.html)() gets the Assets that are referenced by other Assets.
