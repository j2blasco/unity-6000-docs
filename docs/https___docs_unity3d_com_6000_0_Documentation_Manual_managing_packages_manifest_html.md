# Package management with the project manifest file
The **project manifest** Each Unity project has a _project manifest_ , which acts as an entry point for the Package Manager. This file must be available in the `<project>/Packages` directory. The Package Manager uses it to configure many things, including a list of dependencies for that project, as well as any package repository to query for packages. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Glossary.html#Projectmanifest) file stores information that the Package Manager needs to locate and load the right packages, including a list of packages and versions declared as dependencies.
